  - question: Is there a free trial?
    answer: You can enjoy Mailmeteor for free with up to **75 emails a day**. It's more free email quota compared to what you can find in other mail merge solutions. Whenever you want to send more emails, Mailmeteor Premium includes up to 2000 emails, real-time tracking, scheduling, attachments or email alias & more. If you want to benefit from premium features, you can upgrade your account on our [paid plans](/pricing).

  - question: How many emails can I send with Mailmeteor?
    answer: >
      Mailmeteor Premium allows you to send personalized emails up to the limits imposed by Gmail:

        - Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) accounts can send up to 2000 emails per day
        - Gmail accounts (@gmail.com) can send up to 500 emails per day

      Mailmeteor abides by these limits and allows you to send as many emails as you can using your own Gmail account. Your quota varies depending on the type of your Google account (G Suite or Gmail) and your plan. Read more about [email quota](https://support.mailmeteor.com/introduction/quick-start/email-quota).

  - question: How is Mailmeteor different from other mailing solutions?
    answer: >
      Mailmeteor lets you send email campaigns from your Gmail inbox, contrary to email marketing software, like Mailchimp or Sendgrid. Emails sent with Mailmeteor look as if you typed them manually for each contact. It means **better email deliverability, fewer spams and way better opening rates**!


      You can also compare Mailmeteor to other mail merge extensions for Gmail - like [Yet another mail merge](/alternative/yetanothermailmerge) or [Gmass](/alternative/gmass).


      Mailmeteor is different in 3 ways:

        1. **The best rated Google add-on**. Your mail merge experience is made effortless, no computer skills are required.
        2. **Designed to respect your privacy**. Mailmeteor has no access to your Gmail inbox, contrary to other add-ons that ask for read access to your Gmail inbox and Google Drive files.
        3. **Affordable pricing options**. Mailmeteor has a generous free plan and a [simple pricing](/pricing) that works at any scale.

  - question: How can I ensure that my emails won’t go to spam?
    answer: Mailmeteor sends emails directly from your Gmail account and adds a sending delay between each email sent. These mechanisms prevent your emails falling into spam folders. In addition, we strongly recommend you to read our [guidelines to maximize email deliverability](https://support.mailmeteor.com/introduction/sending-guidelines) before sending large volumes of emails.

  - question: How can I personalize my emails?
    answer: >
      You can personalize every part of the email, from subject line to email body, as well as CC/BCC fields. The only limit is your imagination!


      Imagine having a “firstname” column in your spreadsheet, adding *"Hi {{firstname}}"* in your email will be automatically replaced by your recipient’s first name (*"Hi Sally"* for example). You just need to put your variables inside double brackets, like this → {{ }}


      Here are some examples:
        - Personalized email subject: *{{ Mutual connection }} recommended we talk*
        - Personalized greetings and recipients: *Hello {{ firstname }}*
        - Personalized content, custom links, postscriptum...

      Emails sent with Mailmeteor look as if you typed them manually for each of your recipients.

  - question: How does Mailmeteor keep my data safe?
    answer: >
