faqs:
  - question: Why do you need an email marketing platform for real estate agents?
    answer: There's no such thing as a marketing channel that works super well for all types of realtors. Email marketing, like social media and others, is about location, location, location. And by sending emails with Mailmetoer, you are sure to land in your recipients' inbox.
  - question: Why Mailmeteor is the best tool for real estate agents?
    answer: Mailmeteor is an all-in-one marketing automation platform for real estate professionals. With lightweight email editor, web tracking and more, the Mailmeteor platform is perfect for real estate agents to grow your database, run your effective campaigns and convert leads into clients.
  - question: How is Mailmeteor different from other marketing solutions?
    answer: Mailmeteor is the first real estate marketing solution that lets you send automated follow-up emails to your leads. You can schedule a series of emails for follow-up, and Mailmeteor will automatically send those emails, following up with your leads on a schedule you set. When you need to send an emergency email, like a special offer to sell your property, Mailmeteor lets you do that too.
  - question: How can I ensure that my emails won’t go to spam?
    answer: Mailmeteor sends emails directly from your Gmail account and adds a sending delay between each email sent. These mechanisms prevent your emails falling into spam folders. In addition, we strongly recommend you to read our guidelines to maximize email deliverability before sending large volumes of emails.
