description: "The ‘create contacts for auto-complete’ is an awesome feature allowing Gmail to add new email addresses to Other Contacts so that users could autocomplete to them next time when sending a message to same person. However, when people change their name or leave the company and their email address is assigned to someone else, this feature can easily create a lot of confusion and mess. Stalled contacts remain forever making it fairly complex to remove them on a domain level. Contacts Cleaner is designed to allow domain’s super-admins to find and delete these legacy contacts from user’s Other Contacts. These contacts can be removed for all users in the domain, per organization unit or for a specific user."
