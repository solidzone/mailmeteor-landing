description: "JumpCloud's Directory-as-a-Service® (DaaS) is the single point of authority to authenticate, authorize, and manage the identities of a business’s employees and the systems and IT resources they need access to. DaaS securely connects employees with systems, applications, and other resources through a single unified cloud-based directory, replacing the need for on premise solutions such as Active Directory® and LDAP. JumpCloud supports all major OS platforms and is designed to control and manage user access to both internal and external IT resources such as servers and applications."
