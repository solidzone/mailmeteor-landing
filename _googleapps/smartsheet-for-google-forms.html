Now you can send your form responses directly into Smartsheet for advanced project management and collaboration features like attaching related documents, tracking dates in a calendar, setting reminders for your team on due dates, and reporting across projects. And, if you allow users to edit their Google Forms responses, those edits will update the responses stored in Smartsheet."
