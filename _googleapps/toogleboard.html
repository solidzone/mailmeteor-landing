description: "ToogleBoard is a G Suite add-on publishing service. It is managed from ToogleBox by Superadmins and their designated users. The service is used for internal communications, important messages and reminders, without sending emails. Notes to be published are created, edited and previewed in a WYSIWYG HTML editor. Whenever a note is published, G Suite users will see the ToogleBoard icon on the sidebar of the Gmail UI. After clicking on it, a card will appear with a preview image of the message. When clicked, the published note is displayed in a centered window."
