This is a complete guide to mail merge from Gmail in 2022.

In this all-new guide you’ll learn:

- What is mail merge? (and specifically Gmail mail merge)
- How to mail merge and send personalized emails from Gmail
- Is mail merge safe and what are the limitations?
- The other kinds of mail merge techniques that exist

Let’s get started.

**What is a mail merge?**

Let’s say you want to send an email to all your customers, students, or employees. Manually composing emails for each person would take a long time. Instead, you can let your computer do the heavy lifting. That’s a mail merge.

</video>

A mail merge lets you email multiple recipients without them knowing they’re part of a mailing list. Each of your recipients will receive a dedicated personalized email.

A mail merge takes values from rows of a spreadsheet and inserts them into a template email.

**In this guide, we’ll focus on mail merge for Gmail, but you can also mail merge documents or mail merge labels. [See the last section for more details](#5-beyond-mail-merge-for-gmail-discover-the-other-kinds-of-mail-merge).**

![The first mail merge apps were released in the eighties](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-vintage.gif){:width="600px" height="338px"}

_A bit of history: mail merge might be the original productivity killer app. Mail merge has been around since the early days of personal computers. The first mail merge apps appeared during the eighties. They were later popularized by Microsoft Word’s mail merge. With Google taking over the emailing landscape, mail merge was then made possible within Gmail._

## 1. Gmail mail merge for dummies

Mail merge is a time-saving feature for Gmail, allowing you to send personalized emails to multiple recipients at the same time.

![Mail merge personalization](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-gmail-personalize-emails.png){:class="no-shadow"}{:width="600px" height="395px"}

There are various ways to run a mail merge from Gmail. We’ll cover the different methods in the section [How to mail merge in Gmail](/mail-merge-gmail#2-how-to-mail-merge-in-gmail-a-complete-beginners-guide).

Customization works by storing your recipient's information in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. Each row represents a record and each column represents a field. It can be an email, address, company, order number…

</figure>

The spreadsheet will serve as the source for the merge. Each row of the spreadsheet will be processed and inputted into your email template.

![Mail merge spreadsheet example](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-gmail-example.png){:width="600px" height="240px"}

You can personalize every part of the email, from the email subject line to the content. The personalization can include anything from:

- a recipient's name,
- a specific status update,
- a post-scriptum,
- a unique code…

...the customization possibilities are endless.

### Why use mail merge for Gmail?

Email makes a comeback in 2022. For years, email remains the channel generating the best results. It’s a widespread means of communication that is affordable and a perfect way to reach people in a direct way. Studies show that email is still the channel with the highest return on investment. For every $1 spent, email marketing generates a $42 ROI.

There are many ways to send emails, but running a mail merge from Gmail stands out.

The top 5 benefits of mail merge from Gmail are:

1. **A mail merge is simple**. You can start sending your first emails in minutes because a mail merge relies on tools you are already familiar with (Gmail and Google Sheets).
2. **A mail merge is time-saving**. A mail merge completely removes the friction of writing emails to multiple recipients.
3. **A mail merge is personalized**. A <a href="/gmail-mail-merge">Gmail mail merge</a> will make your recipients feel unique when compared to an email blast from an email marketing platform such as Mailchimp or SendGrid.
4. **A mail merge is affordable**. Most mail merge solutions for Gmail will provide a free version. The pricing options will be much less expensive than emailing platforms.
5. **A mail merge is better for email deliverability**. Your emails have more chances to be read and responded to. That’s because emails are sent directly from Gmail servers, ensuring high email deliverability.

### Is mail merge safe? A word on privacy & security

![Is mail merge safe?](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/is-mail-merge-safe.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

Before going any further, it is important to understand how mail merge works. Sending your first mail merge campaign can feel daunting at first. That's OK!

Here are a few things to keep in mind when doing a mail merge with Gmail.

**_Is it allowed to mail merge from Gmail?_**

It is perfectly allowed to mail merge in Gmail. As we will see below, Gmail allows the use of mail merge software and also permits to run a mail merge without an add-on through Apps Script. Using mail merge for automating emailing is right and legal, but spamming is definitely not. We recommend you to abide by simple guidelines to avoid any problems, such as the one established in the CAN-SPAM act.

**_How safe is my data when using a mail merge application?_**

Before installing a mail merge solution for Gmail, pay close attention to the permissions requested before installation.

Some apps will require extensive rights such as the permission to read, modify AND delete your emails. The best is to go for the software that requires minimal permissions.

![Is Mailmeteor safe? Is YAMM safe? Mail merge permissions](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-permissions.png){:width="600px" height="911px"}

**_Can a mail merge harm my email reputation?_**

If your email activity is normal, you should not worry about compromising your reputation. It is important to abide by Google's anti-spam policies to maximize your email deliverability.

As a rule of thumb, Google will block your emails if your email merge meets one of these conditions:

- 10 recipients in your campaign marked your email as spam
- 10 emails fell into your recipients' spam folder

In those cases, you might receive a message from Gmail saying “_you have reached a limit for sending mail. Your message was not sent_”. If your activity is considered spam, your account might be blocked by Gmail too. Fortunately, if you follow the guidelines presented in this guide, you will avoid troubles using mail merge with Gmail.

**_What is the maximum number of emails that I can send from Gmail? What are the limitations of mail merge in Gmail?_**

![Gmail sending limits](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/gmail-sending-limits.png){:width="600px" height="663px"}

Gmail limits the number of emails you can send per day in an effort to keep accounts safe:

- You can send 2000 emails per 24h with a Google Workspace account (formerly G Suite)
- You can send 500 emails per 24h with Gmail accounts (@gmail.com)

[Read more about Gmail sending limits](https://support.google.com/a/answer/166852){:rel="nofollow noopener"}.

If you need to send a larger volume of emails, the best is to opt for an emailing platform, such as Mailchimp, Sendgrid, or Mailjet. These platforms are built to deliver a great number of emails.

## 2. How to mail merge in Gmail: a complete beginner’s guide

There are [2 ways to mail merge in Gmail](/mail-merge-gmail/tutorial). You can either use a Google add-on that will do the job for you or build your own mail merge script in Gmail.

We’ll cover both methods in this guide, even though we recommend using software built for that purpose. Most people will find that mail merge add-ons are easier and safer to use than writing a script.

#### Method 1: How to mail merge in Gmail using Mailmeteor

<video autoplay muted loop playsinline>
  <source src="/assets/video/mailmeteor_demo.mp4">
</video>

We’ll start with a real-life example to show you how to do a mail merge from Gmail using a Google Sheets add-on. In this example, we’re using [Mailmeteor](/), the best rated [Google mail merge add-on](/best-google-apps/mail-merge-gmail).

#### 1. Get Mailmeteor

All you have to do is to [install Mailmeteor from the Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/mailmeteor_for_gmail/1008170693301). The Worskpace Marketplace is a place where you can find all the apps compatible with your Google Suite. Mailmeteor is a tool that integrates with Gmail and Google Sheets to merge emails with Gmail.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/tutorial-mailmeteor-install.png" alt="Install Mailmeteor for Google Sheets" style="box-shadow:none" width="600px" height="381px"/>

#### 2. Add contact in Google Sheets

Once Mailmeteor is installed, [open a Google Sheets spreadsheet](http://sheets.new/).

First of all, you will need to add recipients to a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This spreadsheet will be the place where you store your contact list. You will also be able to track your campaign metrics from there.

To create a mailing list you can either add your recipients manually or import contacts. To import contacts in Google Sheets, go to _Menu > File > Import_ and select your Excel or .csv file.

Here’s a mail merge demo spreadsheet we’re going to use:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/tutorial-spreadsheet-demo-mail-merge.png" alt="Demo spreadsheet to mail merge in Gmail" style="box-shadow:none" width="600px" height="382px"/>
  <figcaption><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RAJPfeW8ehVYGpu6nziKuWmFbog8hJSlcTyKT7FO7iY/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110634960934586502748" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Link to mail merge demo spreadsheet</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="blogpost-note">
<span class="font-weight-bold">Note: </span>when opening Mailmeteor for the first time, you will be guided through a quick onboarding tutorial. A demo spreadsheet like this one will be created for you.
</div>

Let’s breakdown how your spreadsheet should look like:

➤ **Add column headers on the 1st row**

Mailmeteor will pull the information from your spreadsheet to personalize your emails. Each column represents a personalized field. This field will be replaced in your email template.

In our example, we have 4 columns named: firstname, email, company, postscriptum.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/tutorial-spreadsheet-demo-mail-merge.png" alt="Demo spreadsheet to mail merge in Gmail" style="box-shadow:none" width="600px" height="382px"/>

Add as many columns as you want and pick any column header name you want. Make sure you have a column named “email”.

➤ **Fill the columns with your recipients’ information**

Fill your spreadsheet with your recipients’ info. Ensure all email cells are filled with valid email addresses. Apart from the emails, you can leave some cells blank, that is fine! In the example below, some recipients will get a Post Scriptum whereas others won't.

![Fill spreadsheet cells to mail merge in Mailmeteor](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/tutorial-spreadsheet-demo-add-columns.gif){:width="600px" height="338px"}

#### 3. Open Mailmeteor from the Add-ons menu in Google Sheets

Once your contact list is ready, open Mailmeteor. To open Mailmeteor go to the menu and select Add-ons> Mailmeteor > Open Mailmeteor.

<img src="/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/tutorial-mailmeteor-addon.png" alt="Mailmeteor add-on to mail merge in Google Sheets" style="box-shadow:none" width="600px" height="382px"/>

This is the Mailmeteor interface. It tells you how many emails you can send per day and details related to your campaign. Next, we are going to compose the template that will be used for the mail merge.

#### 4. Compose a new email template

Click on the “Create new template” button. This will open an editor in which you can compose your email. The Mailmeteor editor is the exact same as Gmail, you will find all the actions you need to customize your email.

![Create a new template in Mailmeteor](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/tutorial-mailmeteor-compose-template.gif){:width="600px" height="408px"}

Now we’re going to personalize your email. Personalizing emails is important as it helps make your recipients feel unique when they receive your emails. Using personalization will also dramatically improve your opening rates - and thus the replies you will get.

#### 5. Personalize your emails

A mail merge transforms a standard email template into a personalized email copy. It’s done by replacing variables fields within the template with the content from your spreadsheet.

To insert a variable it’s easy: add variables using double brackets like this \{\{ firstname \}\}

Here is a template you can copy-paste:

<div class="blogpost-endnote">
<p>Hello {% raw %}{{ firstname }}{% endraw %},</p>

<p>I'm glad we could meet lately. As discussed, we are using a brand new mail merge solution called Mailmeteor.</p>

<p>Mailmeteor lets you send hundreds of personalized emails, right from Gmail.</p>

<p>I’d love to let you see some of the features to get your feedback. We want to ensure Mailmeteor would actually help you do your job better at {% raw %}{{ company }}{% endraw %}.</p>

<p>Would you have 10-15 minutes free to chat? (I promise to keep the time!). Let me know the time that suits you best.</p>

</div>

When adding a variable, always make sure that it matches a header in your spreadsheet.

Once you are satisfied with your template, click the “**Save**” button.

#### 6. Preview emails before sending

Mailmeteor offers a preview feature that is super helpful to review emails before sending. The preview mode gives you a glimpse of the actual output of your email once personalized for each recipient.

![Preview mail merge before sending](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/tutorial-mailmeteor-preview-mail-merge.gif){:width="600px" height="408px"}

You can also send a test email to yourself. Testing your emails on several devices is a best practice. This will ensure your emails will display correctly in most situations.

#### 7. Send your mail merge

Ready for take-off? It’s time to send your mailmerge campaign.

We know that sending your mail merge can be a bit daunting at first. No worries though, if you follow these steps, everything will be alright!

![Sending a mail merge with Mailmeteor](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/tutorial-mailmeteor-sending-mail-merge.gif){:width="600px" height="408px"}

✨ That's it! You are now ready to mail merge emails with Gmail using an add-on such as Mailmeteor ✨

_Here's a real-life example. Watch this teacher use Mailmeteor to mail merge emails to his students:_

### Method 2: How to build a merge in Gmail using Google Apps Scripts

If you rather fancy homemade solutions or if you can’t install third-party software, then it’s possible build your own Gmail mail merge without an add-on.

We’re going to use Google Apps Script, which makes it easy to create and publish Google add-ons. The script presented here was written by Martin Hawksey (@mhawksey).

Here is the open-source code of the [script hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/googleworkspace/solutions/blob/master/mail-merge/src/Code.js){:rel="nofollow noreferrer"}.

![Create your own mail merge with Gmail using Apps Script](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-apps-script-example.gif){:width="600px" height="386px"}

Follow the guidelines below to understand how to mail merge in Gmail using Apps Script:

1. **Create a copy of the sample mail merge spreadsheet**

   Open this [demonstration spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EfjLuYGab8Xt8wCn4IokBIG0_W4tBtiU4vxl3Y7FPsA/copy) and click on “Make a copy” to get your own copy.

2. **In the spreadsheet, update the “Recipients” column with email addresses you would like to use in the mail merge**

   Replace the cells’ value under the “Recipients” column with your own email address for example.

3. **Open Gmail to create a new draft email. Use tags to personalize your template**

   You can use personalized variables, like \{\{ First name \}\}, which correspond to column names of the spreadsheet you just copied. This indicates text you’d like to be replaced with data from the copied spreadsheet.

4. **Back in the copied spreadsheet, click on the custom menu item called “Mail Merge” and then click on “Send Emails”**

   This item menu was created by the Apps Script and will start the mail merge process.

5. **A dialog box appears for authorization. Read the authorization notice and continue.**

   When prompted enter or copy-paste the subject line used in your draft Gmail message. Then click OK.

6. **Send your emails**

   You will see that the “Email Sent” column will update with the message status. Back in Gmail, check your [Sent folder](https://mail.google.com/mail/#sent){:rel="nofollow noreferrer"} and review the emails the program just sent for you!

<div class="blogpost-note">
  <span class="font-weight-bold">Important note: </span>The script we are using has been created and proofreaded by Google Apps Script teams. You can also look at <a href="/mail-merge-gmail/script">a basic mail merge script</a> written by Mailmeteor team. But always be super careful when authorizing scripts and third-party apps in general.
</div>

Keep in mind that using a script is at your own risk. Check Gmail’s sending limit before sending large volumes of emails. Be aware that your account can get blocked by Gmail if your emailing activity seems unusual in the eyes of anti-spam filters.

For these reasons, we would recommend using a mail merge solution such as [Mailmeteor](https://mailmeteor.com). Mailmeteor deals with all these aspects for you and ensures that your privacy remains protected.

## 3. Mail merge Gmail tips: how to avoid spam and increase your opening rate

### The best practices to send mail merge with Gmail

In email marketing, [email deliverability](/blog/gmail-deliverability) is the number of emails that actually reach your recipients’ inbox.

Here are the best practices to increase your email deliverability when sending a mail merge:

#### 1. Warm-up your Gmail account

![Mail merge tip: warm up your Gmail account](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-tips-warm-up-email-account.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

Your Gmail account is brand new or it’s been a long time since you sent emails?

We recommend warming-up your account by slowly increasing your sending volume over time.

Gmail monitors any unusual activity happening on your account. If you start sending 2000 emails per day out of the blue, you are likely to get blocked in no time.

Thus, try sending emails to a small list of recipients at first (50 recipients for example). Then increase the volume if you start to get promising results (good opening rates, click rates or replies).

#### 2. Don't send too many emails at once

![Mail merge tip: stagger your email campaigns](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-tips-stagger-email-campaigns.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

It’s a best practice to send emails only to a fragment of recipients at first. Test the temperature, and send the rest of the emails depending on the results. For example, send your email to 10-20 people and wait until you get some engagement, should it be clicks or replies.

Once you are confident with your email, send the rest of the campaign.

For large campaigns, try sending emails to one group of recipients. Wait 24 hours, and then send to the other half of your recipients. Always try to stagger mass communications over several days when you can.

<div class="blogpost-note">
  <span class="font-weight-bold">Good to know:</span> most mail merge solutions offer to segment your database by filtering your spreadsheet.
</div>

#### 3. Make sure your contact list is clean

![Mail merge tip: clean your email database](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-tips-clean-email-database.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

When you send emails to invalid or outdated recipients, it sends a bad signal to Gmail. Your emails cannot reach their destination and bounce back.

If your campaigns have a lot of bounces, Google will detect that your database is outdated or might not be legitimate.

We recommended you to keep your database as clean as possible. You can ensure that your database is clean by collecting emails yourself. Doing so, ensure that people consent to receive future communications. By engaging with your audience frequently, you’ll be able to keep an active database of recipients.

Generally speaking, it’s not a good idea to buy an emailing list, you will end up harming your email reputation. Some companies offer email verification services. We can mention Hunter, Zerobounce or Neverbounce, among others. These services will help you remove invalid or outdated email addresses from your database.

#### 4. Review your email content and formatting before sending

![Mail merge tip: review your emails before sending](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-tips-review-emails.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

Anti-spam filters can check email content and formatting to ensure the mail merge does not contain phishing or scam. Things you can check before sending your mail merge campaign:

- **Email formatting:** keep formatting as simple as possible. Avoid uppercases, using a combination of fonts or colors or the abusive use of exclamation marks.
- **Email content:** look for any spam trigger words in your emails such as anything related to money or sexual relationships.
- **Email headers:** these include the Date, From, To, and Subject of your email. Spam filters will check these fields to ensure there is nothing unusual there.
- **Structure of your email:** your email is made of the HTML language. Unstructured HTML code will look suspect in the eyes of spam filters. Try to write your email directly in the email editor instead of copy-pasting bits of texts from places like Google Docs.

Here are a few services you can use to check your emails before sending them: [Spamcheck by Postmark](https://spamcheck.postmarkapp.com/){:rel="nofollow noreferrer"}, [Mail-tester](https://www.mail-tester.com/){:rel="nofollow noreferrer"} or [Glock Apps’s spam testing](https://glockapps.com/spam-testing/){:rel="nofollow noreferrer"}.

#### 5. Personalize your emails

![Mail merge tip: personalize your emails](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-tips-personalize-emails.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

When sending [mass emails from Gmail](/mass-emails-gmail), it’s generally a good idea to personalize your emails. Not only personalizing your email might certainly increase your open rate but also will help fight against spam.

The more your emails are personalized, the better.

#### 6. Provide a clear way to opt-out

![Mail merge tip: provide a clear way to opt-out](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-tips-unsubscribe.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

It is strongly recommended - and sometimes compulsory - to include a simple way to opt-out from your email communications.

Depending on the type of audience you are engaging with you might have to provide an unsubscribe mean. Try using a closing formula such as "_let me know if you don't wish to receive more emails_" to unsubscribe or adding an unsubscribe link.

When people ask you to opt-out, you cannot ignore their request. You might check the laws against spam applicable in your country before sending mail merge campaigns in Gmail. Check our complete guide for more [Gmail deliverability tips](/blog/gmail-deliverability).

### Mail merge Gmail advanced features

Beyond sending emails, a mail merge offers more advanced features such as tracking emails, attaching files or scheduling your campaign in advance. Let’s review the possibilities offered by the most popular mail merge software:

#### Mail merge tracking

When sending a mail merge, you can track the engagement generated by your emails. It’s possible to track email opens or clicks for example.

![Email tracking in mail merge Gmail](/assets/img/features/tracking.png){:width="600px" height="386px"}

**_How does mail merge tracking work?_**

The tracking system implemented by [mail merge Gmail](https://mailmergegmail.com) software is industry standard. It works by adding a small image (called a 1x1 pixel) on the bottom of each email you send. Every time someone opens your email, it downloads that small image and the software records that event in its database.

The downside of adding a pixel to track opens is that email open tracking might not be 100% accurate.

Email open tracking’s accuracy depends on email providers. Some email providers are downloading the tracking pixel before your recipients actually open the mail. This is the reason why some emails are marked as opened immediately after sending a mail merge campaign. Other email providers are blocking images by default. This means that sometimes your email will be marked as sent only, while it has been opened by your recipient.

  <span class="font-weight-bold">Pro tip:</span> you should not rely on opens only to assess the performance of your email campaign. It's better to track metrics like clicks or replies rather than just opens, because these metrics let you know how people engaged with your emails.
</div>

Mail merge add-ons also let you know how many people clicked your email. The tracking techniques here are different from email open tracking. Each mail merge solution will opt for a different method.

For example, Mailmeteor applies an identifier to your link that is unique to your account. This ensures not only accurate clicked tracking but also high deliverability. Indeed, each link is solely tied to your own email reputation.

#### Mail merge with attachments in Gmail

Wondering if you can mail merge emails with attachments? Yup, that's possible!

![Add attachments in mail merge](/assets/img/features/attachments.png){:width="600px" height="386px"}

Most advanced mail merge solutions allow you to attach files and documents to your email. It’s a convenient way to distribute documents such as invoices, event invitations, and more.

Here’s what’s happening in the background: the file will be downloaded from your computer and attached to your email. In other cases, the file can also be pulled in from your Google Drive folder.

<div class="blogpost-note">
  <span class="font-weight-bold">Note:</span> Gmail max attachment size limit is 25 MB. You can use Google Drive to mail merge with attachments should you need to go over this limit.
</div>

What if I want to send personalized attachments using a mail merge in Gmail?

Tools like Mailmeteor or Mail merge with attachments will let you mail merge personalized attachments. It’s perfect when you want to send different attachments when emailing multiple recipients. If you want to learn more, we wrote a dedicated article about [mail merge in Gmail with attachments](/mail-merge-gmail/with-attachment).

#### Mail merge Gmail Cc and Bcc

Just like in Gmail, it’s possible to include Cc and Bcc recipients to your mail merge.

![Add Cc or Bcc to mail merge in Gmail](/assets/img/features/cc-bcc.png){:width="600px" height="386px"}

To CC and BCC in a mail merge using Gmail and Google Sheets, you only need to add a dedicated column for Cc or Bcc recipients in your spreadsheet.

For example, add a column named “Cc” and fill in cells with your recipients’ emails. You can add several recipients by separating addresses with commas.

<div class="blogpost-note">
  <span class="font-weight-bold">Good to know:</span> some people use the BCC field because they don’t want their recipients to know who else is receiving the email. It’s considered as a bad practice. With a mail merge there is no need to put everyone in BCC! You can email each recipient without letting them know they’re part of a grouped mailing list.
</div>

#### Scheduling a mail merge in Gmail

To schedule a mail merge to be sent at a later time, it works quite the same as in Gmail.

![Schedule mail merge in Gmail](/assets/img/features/scheduling.png){:width="600px" height="347px"}

Select the scheduling option then pick the date and time you want your emails to be sent at. In Mailmeteor, the button is the same as in Gmail. Click on the arrow on the right of the "Send" button to access the scheduling interface.

![Scheduling a mail merge in Gmail with Mailmeteor](/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail/mail-merge-gmail-schedule-emails.png)

It’s worth mentioning here that scheduled emails may be sent a few minutes after the scheduled time. This is due to Gmail processing your scheduled emails. Plus, your emails will be sent based on the timezone you schedule them in.

Voilà! You just learn how to schedule emails for sending later with Gmail mail merge.

#### Add images to mail merge in Gmail

A picture is worth a thousand words. It’s possible to add images in your mail merge in Gmail.

![Add images in your Gmail mail merge](/assets/img/features/html.png){:width="600px" height="386px"}

**When adding images to your email, you should take two things into account:**

1. **Some email providers will not download your images or display them correctly**. Hence you should always write your email having in mind the possibility of your images not being displayed.
2. **Your emails should always contain more text than images**. A good image-to-text ratio is made of no more than 40% image coverage and a minimum of 60% text. Following this guideline will keep you out of any deliverability issues.

#### Add unsubscribe link to mail merge in Gmail

Adding a way for your recipients to unsubscribe from your mail merge is strongly recommended (see why above).

![Add unsubscribe link in mail merge Gmail](/assets/img/features/unsubscribe.png){:width="600px" height="386px"}

The good news is that you can easily include a 1-click unsubscribe button in your mail merge in Gmail with tools like Mailmeteor.

Your recipient will be able to opt-out from your emails in just a click, thanks to specific headers added to your email.

**_When is it ok to send a mail merge without an unsubscribe link?_**

As long as you are writing to people who know you, that you're not sending repeated emails to these people with commercial intent, it’s OK. Let’s say you are sending an email to your relatives, colleagues, partners, clients, or students, there is no specific need to add an unsubscribe mean.

On the other hand, always include an unsubscribe option when sending cold emails or [marketing newsletters in Gmail](/gmail-marketing). Cold emails are unsolicited emails to recipients you have had no interaction with in the past.

I can’t emphasize this enough: mail merge emails in Gmail is legal, sending unsolicited and spam emails is not!

#### Mail merge Gmail CRM integration

You can keep track of your conversations sent through a Gmail mail merge within your favorite CRMs.

![Log your mail merged emails into your CRM](/assets/img/features/crm.png){:width="600px" height="386px"}

The most popular CRMs, such as Salesforce or Hubspot, offer to log conversations generated by your mail merge in Gmail using a Bcc address. All you have to do is to Bcc the email address provided by your CRM application and your email conversations will then be logged into the CRM.
