Done correctly, a mail merge can make your life a lot easier by drawing up a list of contacts from a [Google spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) you already have and letting you send each contact a message at the same time from Gmail.

In this blog, we’re going to answer your questions about **using Google Sheets to mail merge in Gmail**, offering some advice on what the best methods are and what extra features you can take advantage of with your emails. Read on to find out more!

## Can you mail merge from Google Sheets?

It's possible to mail merge emails in Gmail using Google sheets. With a little help from Google add-ons, it’s the easiest thing in the world.

All you need is a Google account with Gmail or a Google Workspace account. Once you have everything set up, mail merging is a simple and efficient process.

As an added benefit if you’re on a budget, a [Gmail mail merge](/gmail-mail-merge) itself can be **free** when you mail merge from Google Sheets (minus add-on costs), so it’s well worth learning the actual process and practice of mail merging for both the short-and-long-term financial benefits.

## How do I mail merge from Google Sheets to Gmail?

There are two ways you can mail merge with Google Sheets in Gmail.

### 1. Mail merge in Gmail using a Google Sheets add-on

The first and easiest method is to use a mail merge add-on for Google Sheets. Something like [Mailmeteor](/) covers all of the scripting and all of the technical bits for you so that all you have to do is write the email template and link it with a Google Sheets contact list.

It’s straightforward, quick, and comes with an array of different features making it the most popular choice for many. You can use Google add-ons from the ‘Add-ons’ menu at the top of Google Sheets.

### 2. Mail merge in Gmail without an add-on

The second way is to [build a mail merge script](/mail-merge-gmail/script) to tell Gmail how to draw the contact information from Google Sheets. This method can be very effective, but you’ll need to have the tech skills and training to carry it out properly without any issues.

## Why is mail merging with Google Sheets the best option for my mail merge?

Perhaps the best thing about mail merging using Google Sheets is that an add-on like [Mailmeteor](/) can provide a range of special and advanced features, designed to help you get the most out of every mail merge email you send.

Find below some concrete examples of what you can achieve by combining the power of Google Sheets and Gmail:

- **Personalizing emails** – Once you have your email template, you can personalize all of your emails with Mailmeteor variables stored in your Google Sheets spreadsheet, letting you add a human touch to every message in the mail merge to foster new relationships and improve your open rates.

- **CC or BCC recipients** – Get more people involved in your email conversations by adding CC or BCC recipients to your mail merge, provided automatically through data drawn from Google Sheets - all done simply by adding a column named “Cc” or “Bcc” to your spreadsheet.

- **Segmented contact mail merges** – By filtering your Google Sheets spreadsheet, you can split up and mail merge to different segments of your contact list according to different metrics, such as people who didn’t open your last mail merge email, or those who took the time to respond.
