Gmail is the most popular email platform, with over 1.8 billions active users in 2021. Unfortunately, Gmail does not have a built-in solution to send a mail merge from an Excel. You need to use a third-party solution such as Mailmeteor, which let you send a mail merge from an Excel file (or a .CSV).

First, here's what you need to send emails in Gmail using an Excel file:

- Have a Gmail account or a Google Workspace account (formely GSuite);
- Have a mailing list in an Excel file ([here's an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oH6COWBVweMoPMtXmVGzcBqnb9Kw4dM3AyaMhaisqRI/edit?usp=sharing)).

Now let's see the 5 steps to reproduce to send emails to your mailing list stored in an Excel file.

## Step 1. Import your Excel file in Google Sheets

1. [Open a new Google Sheets](htttps://sheets.new).
1. In the menu, select "File" > "Import".

1. Head over to "Upload" and drag & drop your Excel file.

1. Once the file is uploaded, click on "Replace spreadsheets" to complete the import.
1. Your Excel file is now imported in Google Sheets:

Here's a video tutorial on how to do it:

</div>

## Step 2. Open Mailmeteor

Right from Google Sheets, in the menu, select "Add-ons" > "Mailmeteor" > "Open Mailmeteor"

If you don't have Mailmeteor, just [open this link](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/mailmeteor_mail_merge_for_gmail/1008170693301) to install the add-on in a few seconds.

## Step 3. Compose your template in Mailmeteor

1. In Mailmeteor, click on "Create a new template":

1. Then, write the subject line as well as your email:
   <img src="/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail-excel/mailmeteor-draft.jpg" alt="Example of a draft for a mail merge in Mailmeteor" width="600" height="461"/>
1. Once you are ready, click "Save template"!

## Step 4. Preview your email

Previewing your email before sending it is a good practice to make sure everything looks right.

1. In Mailmeteor, click on "Preview emails":
   <img src="/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail-excel/mailmeteor-preview-email-button.jpg" alt="Preview button in Mailmeteor" width="600" height="461"/>
1. The preview renders exactly as your recipient will see your email:
   <img src="/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail-excel/mailmeteor-preview-email.jpg" alt="Preview of a mail merge in Mailmeteor" width="600" height="461"/>

If you need to make a change, just click on the <img src="/assets/img/blog/mail-merge-gmail-excel/mailmeteor-pen-icon.jpg" alt="A pen icon" class="no-shadow" style="display: inline; margin: 0; width: 30px; height: 27px;" /> icon. Then you can preview the email again.

## Step 5. Hit send!

Whenever you're ready, click on "Send emails" and your emails will shortly be sent with Mailmeteor.
