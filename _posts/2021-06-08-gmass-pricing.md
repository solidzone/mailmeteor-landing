If you want to send mass personalized emails with Gmail, you’ll need access to a Google mail merge extension 1 makes a mail merge in Gmail as simple, straightforward and hassle-free as possible.

GMass is just one of these extensions, using Gmail’s powerful email platform to send a large number of emails to your contact lists with the click of a button.

But what exactly is GMass? Is it worth the money you’ll pay for the subscription? In this blog, we’re going to take a deep dive into the GMass extension, comparing it to other [Gmail marketing](/gmail-marketing) tools to help you make an informed decision about the best mail merge solution.

**Note: on November 15th 2021, [GMass raised its pricing for all plans](https://www.gmass.co/blog/upcoming-price-changes/){:rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"}. We have updated this blog article to review the latest changes introduced in GMass pricing.**

## What is GMass?

Gmass is a **mail merge extension for Gmail**. It allows you to send multiple emails to a great number of people at the same time, including sequences of emails for marketing campaigns.

GMass was created by Ajay Goel (@PartTimeSnob on Twitter), a Chicago based entrepreneur who previously built an emailing company called JangoMail. In a recent GMass blog article, Ajay Goel claimed his company is now making more than $200K/month and that the GMass team has grown to twenty people, four of them being fulltime.

GMass comes as a Google Chrome extension that lives inside your Gmail account (this means you must have Google Chrome as your browser to use GMass).

When installing GMass, a new set of icons will appear in your Gmail interface. Behind the scenes, the GMass extension draws information about who to include in the mail merge directly from Google Sheets, where your contact list is stored. You can also send emails directly from Gmail, by copy pasting your email list in the recipients field.

GMass also offers side products, [including a free email warmup tool](/blog/best-email-warmup-tools#8-email-warmup-by-gmass), a spam tester or an email verification service. GMass’ comprehensive array of features contributed to its success on the market for mail merge with Gmail - though **GMass's pricing can make it a really expensive option**.

## How to mail merge in Gmail with GMass

Mail merge in Gmail is an effective way of sending out multiple emails to big contact lists. Mail merging emails saves you the invaluable time and effort it would take to do so on an individual basis. Here are the steps to get started with GMass.

</div>
<br>

1. Install [GMass Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmass-powerful-mail-merge/ehomdgjhgmbidokdgicgmdiedadncbgf){:rel="nofollow noreferrer"}
2. Log into Gmail
3. Click on the newly created GMass icon representing a spreadsheet
4. Choose a Google Sheets you want to pull data from (name and addresses for example)
5. A new Gmail compose window will appear. It contains the recipients filled with the people from your contact list
6. Compose your email template. You can personalize your emails by clicking on the red Gmass down arrow and then “Personalize emails”
7. Click the GMass Button to send emails

<div class="blogpost-note">
  <p class="font-weight-bold">Here is a list of GMass features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mail merge in Gmail with data from Google Sheets.</li>
    <li>Personalize mass emails based on name, email address, and any available columns in Google Sheets.</li>
    <li>Schedule mass emails to be sent later.</li>
    <li>Track email engagement rates, such as opens and clicks.</li>
    <li>Send follow-up emails to people that opened, clicked, or replied to a previous campaign, or to those that did NOT open, click, or reply.</li>
    <li>Create recipient lists based on search results in Gmail.</li>
    <li>Connect to an external SMTP service like Sendgrid.</li>
    <li>Send emails as replies to the last conversation you had with each recipient.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Now that you know how to send emails with GMass, here are a few things to consider:

**Browser compatibility**. You can only use GMass with Google Chrome. Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari and software like Microsoft Outlook are yet to be supported. Gmass for Outlook is not supported either, as thought you could use an Outlook address as an alias to send emails from that account.

**GMass and Zapier**. Though there is no official Zapier integration with GMass, you could build a Zapier connection with the new GMass API released in March 2021.

**Complicated interface**. As you can see GMass is as powerful as it can be complex. The add-on adds a ton of new buttons and you need to go through several steps in order to send your emails. We’ll see easier methods to [send mass emails with Gmail](/mass-emails-gmail), using our add-on called [Mailmeteor](/) at the end of this article.

## Is GMass free?

So far, so good – but **how much does GMass really cost?** GMass pricing has two versions – one is the free version, the other is paid.

![GMass pricing](/assets/img/blog/gmass-pricing/Gmass-pricing.webp){:width="600px" height="388px"}

In terms of what you get for free, GMass gives you access to almost all of the features of the extension, though **you can only send messages in your mail merge to up to 50 people a day**.

That limit is lifted with the paid version which has a number of subscription options for different needs and requirements. If you’re just one person, looking to mail merge for yourself, you’ll want the individual subscription package. If you’re a business, you can access the team subscription package which allows you to have multiple people on the same GMass account for a discounted fee.

For both of these options, you can choose either the standard GMass mail merge product or the premium model. This is where things _get complicated_.

The standard package gets you unlimited use and almost all features for $19.95 a month. The premium package by comparison gives you all of that, as well as the sequences and follow-up features that let you create concurrent emails and send them automatically. This package costs **$29.95 a month for individuals**. The team pricing starts at **$125 per month for 5 users on premium**.

These prices can be paid on either a monthly basis or an annual one, with the annual payments coming with a slight discount over their monthly counterparts. The standard annual packages come in at $199 a year, while the premium is $299. GMass made some changes to its pricing lately. In 2020, GMass removed the distinction between Gmail and G Suite accounts and withdrew the Minimal plan that included a GMass footer.

**On November 15th 2021, GMass raised its pricing.** Here is a summary of what's new:

- **GMass is now more expensive**. For example the Premium plan now costs <u>$100 more</u> than what it used to be before the change ($299 instead of $199). You'll have to pay an <u>additional $10 each month</u> if you are on the monthly plan ($29.95 instead of $19.95).
- **Usage-based billing for emails sent via SMTP**. GMass is now charging users $0.40 per 1,000 emails transmitted to an SMTP service, with the first 10,000 emails being free.
- **If you owned GMass account prior to the pricing change, your plan will be updated with the new pricing on the next renewal**. All users that are on the old plans will be moved to the new pricing plans starting from November 15th 2021.

<div class="blogpost-note">
  <p>
  <span class="font-weight-bold">Important note:</span> if you want to get immediate support from the GMass team, you will have to pay a fee to get someone to answer your questions. Otherwise, GMass claims itself as a "low-cost, self-service system" so better not to have an urgent issue with the service!
  </p>
</div>

In conclusion, GMass offers a lot of pricing options with starting prices that are up to **twice more expensive than other mail merge solutions such as Mailmeteor** (see a comparison between [GMass vs Mailmeteor](/alternative/gmass)).

## How do I install the GMass extension?

Installing the [GMass extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gmass-powerful-mail-merge/ehomdgjhgmbidokdgicgmdiedadncbgf){:rel="nofollow noreferrer"} is quite simple.

To get GMass, you’ll need to head to the Chrome Web Store. Once you’re there, just navigate up to the top right corner of your screen where you should see a blue button that says _Add to Chrome_.

![GMass Chrome extension](/assets/img/blog/gmass-pricing/Gmass-extension.webp){:width="600px" height="471px"}

Click this and follow the on-screen instructions to get GMass set up on your Google Chrome browser. After that, no need to access a GMass login because the extension lives inside Gmail.

## How many emails can I send at a time with GMass?

Generally, and this is the same for most mail merge software. GMass lets you send up to **2000 emails per day with Gmail (limited to 500 emails per day for @gmail.com free accounts)**. You can send up to 10,000 emails by distributing the emails over multiple days automatically, based on your Gmail account’s sending limits.

GMass gets around this limit by automatically spreading your mail merge over a few days, so that you send a set number of emails a day within the limits. This means you can send unlimited emails with GMass, though the more you send, the more days it’ll take for the mail merge to be completed.

## Is GMass safe?

GMass is trusted by hundreds of clients, with regular positive GMass reviews. As such, it’s considered to be a safe platform to send mass emails with Gmail. You can learn more about the privacy of the GMass extension with their [privacy policy](https://www.gmass.co/blog/gmass-privacy-information-what-data-does-our-server-store){:rel="nofollow noreferrer"}.

Note that **GMass requires extensive permissions to your inbox data in order to run. GMass can read and change your Gmail inbox data**. If you are concerned about privacy and data protection, you might want to consider [Mailmeteor](/) as a best alternative to GMass. Read more about [how Mailmeteor protects your data](https://support.mailmeteor.com/help/privacy).

<div class="blogpost-note">
  <p class="font-weight-bold">Is GMass from Google?</p>
  <p>No, GMass isn’t a Google product - it’s an independent Chrome extension that has been designed for Gmail. The company that makes GMass is based in Chicago, USA.</p>

## Gmass vs Mailchimp

![Gmass vs Mailchimp comparison](/assets/img/blog/gmass-pricing/Gmass-vs-Mailchimp.webp){:width="600px" height="300px"}

Let’s see how Gmass compares with the Chimp. Mailchimp is probably the most well-known solution to send email marketing campaigns. Mailchimp has been around for 20 years now and evolved over the years to a complete email platform with robust features. Their pricing increased steeply too, which now makes Mailchimp more enterprise oriented than it was in the past.

The main difference between Mailchimp and a mail merge service like GMass is that **emails are not sent directly from your Gmail account with Mailchimp**. This might affect your email deliverability as you will get higher engagement rates when sending directly from your email account. That's because you control your own email reputation.

Mailchimp starts at $9.99 per month for 500 contacts. GMass on the other hand starts at $19.95 per month. But since GMass pricing does not depend on the number of contacts you have, it might be more affordable to use it instead of Mailchimp depending on your needs.

Also, take into account that **both tools have different purposes**.

Even though both GMass and Mailchimp can be used to send emails, their end goal is different. Mailchimp is an email marketing platform that will be suitable for sending large amounts of emails at once. For example, sending a newsletter to 50K contacts at once. GMass will be more adapted for smaller targeted email campaigns, for example a cold email outreach to a few hundreds of recipients.

## The best alternative to GMass: Mailmeteor

So far, GMass sounds like an excellent mail merge solution with a wide range of useful features. For many however, the steep GMass pricing plan for the paid version along with the complicated user interface has seen many users turn to other alternatives that are better suited to their needs.

The [best alternative to GMass](/alternative/gmass) is Mailmeteor, an equally powerful mail merge tool that costs a lot less, and makes the entire process easier and more straightforward.

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" title="Mailmeteor Product Tour" show-info="O" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YX65-kywOE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen loading="lazy"></iframe>
</div>
<br>

Here are some ways that Mailmeteor can offer a better standard of mail merge than the GMass tool:

- **Privacy-focused** – As part of the extension, GMass requires its users to give permission for the tool to read access for your Gmail inbox and your Google Drive files. Mailmeteor doesn’t require access to anything – just the contact list data in your Google Sheets file.

- **Affordable price plan** – GMass pricing can leave a fairly hefty hole in your finances over the course of a year, with a standard package for individuals costing $129. Mailmeteor offers similar features for 2.5 times less than that at $49. If we’re looking at the team accounts, that difference is even greater - Mailmeteor team accounts are up to 5 times cheaper.

- **Generous free version** – Like GMass, Mailmeteor offers customers an entirely free version with a full range of features. Unlike GMass however, Mailmeteor users with free accounts can send emails to 75 recipients every day - not just 50.

- **Simpler to use** – Mailmeteor let you send mass personalized emails within minutes. Anyone who wants to send a mail merge can do so quickly and easily, even if you're not tech-savvy!
