**Type:** Google add-on

Mailmeteor is one of the most popular and most established Gmail mail merge extensions on the Google Workspace Marketplace today. In just three years, it has been ranked as the best-rated Google add-on, now used by more than 3 million users.

The extension was founded by Jean Dubrulle and Corentin Brossault, two Google specialists and entrepreneurs from Paris, France. Prior to building Mailmeteor, they were using other mail merge add-ons but got frustrated by their complex interface, lack of customer support and the invasive permissions requested by these tools to user's private data.

Their vision was to build an intuitive, affordable and privacy-focus mail merge application that would be accessible to beginners, experts and everyone in between. What they came up with was an add-on that prioritized privacy and efficiency above everything else, granting a complete set of features for a budget-friendly price.

**Mailmeteor Pricing**

One of the most affordable mail merge options on the market, [Mailmeteor's pricing](https://mailmeteor.com/pricing) starts at $9.99 per month or $49.99 per year. Mailmeteor offers a free version that you can use to send up to 150 emails per day for free. The premium version comes with all unlimited features. There are also options dedicated to teams and enterprise, with competitive pricing as you increase the number of seats in your license.

**Type:** Google add-on

Founded in Malta by Andrew Dimech, Quicklution is a Google add-on creator, building extensions that are designed to streamline processes for businesses of all sizes. Their mail merge offers personalization, contact list linking with Google docs and other handy features, though it does spread itself a little thinly across those features, rather than focusing on getting the essentials right. The add-on itself has a lot of similarities with the Mail Merge Wizard in Microsoft Word.

**Mail Merge Pricing**

Quicklution opted for a classic pricing, with two options only. The starting price is $30 for a yearly plan and $80 for a lifetime license that will grant you access for life. Then, Quicklution offers discounts based on the number of users included in a license.

</div>

**Type:** Google add-on

This mail merge extension for Gmail is aimed at those looking to send mail merges with attachments, making it easier to send multiple documents, pictures, videos and more to multiple contacts. Though most mail merge extensions offer to attach documents to your emails now, the Mail Merge With Attachments extensions by Digital Inspiration (Labnol) remained an active player among the different mail merge services for Gmail.

Built by developer Amit Argawal from Agra India, Mail Merge With Attachments does its main job of mail merging with attachments well, but may fall short on the other parts that make up a good mail merge extension.

**Mail Merge with Attachments Pricing**

Mail Merge with Attachments pricing starts at $39 per year for individual users and $87 dollars for enterprise users. Though the pricing on their website is displayed per month, the license will be billed annually. Like other mail merge applications, there's an option to buy a license for a G Suite domain as a whole.

**Type:** Google Workspace add-on

One of the new mail merge extensions, Mergo stands as mail merge for Gmail that prides itself on its simplicity, providing a mail merge add-on built with Google Cards service. Built by Romain Vialard who created YAMM, Mergo has a bright future ahead of it. The add-on is displayed as a sidebar only, which on the one hand is pretty convenient to use when you need to switch between your Google Sheets tabs, but might be limited in terms of user interface.

**Mergo Pricing**

Mergo has not disclosed its pricing yet at the date of publishing this article.

</div>

**Type:** Google Chrome extension

Streak is a CRM (customer relationship management) tool designed specifically for GMail by Aleen Mawani and Omar Ismail of San Francisco in 2011. Focused on using spreadsheets to connect with customers in a number of ways, Streak also includes a mail merge function – thought this function lacks the feature list and design focus of extensions that have a sole focus on mail merging.

**Streak Pricing**

Streak has a free version with a limited mail merge functionality for up to 50 recipients. Streak's pricing is then divided in 3 tiers: Solo, Pro, Enterprise. The Solo Plan will let you mail merge up to 800 recipients maximum for $19 per month or $180 per year. If you want to send emails up to Gmail limits, then you will have to opt for the Pro plan starting at $59 per month or $588 per year. In short, Steak offers a mail merge feature as part of its CRM for Gmail, but it's clearly not its core feature.

**Streak Features**

**Type:** Google Chrome extension

Founded back in 2014 by Olof Mathé in San Francisco, Mixmax is a dynamic and helpful extension, designed to open up Gmail and add a set of useful features to the email platform.

Mixmax offers up to 5 different plans depending on your team size. To mail merge in Gmail, you will need the SMB or an upward plan. The SMB plan starts at $29 per month or $288 per year. There's a free version available but it applies a &quot;Mixmax&quot; signature in your email footer and doesn't come with a mail merge feature.

**Type:** Emailing platform

Created by Seattle developer Ahmad AlNaimi in 2015, Vocus is an extension that turns Gmail into an all-singing, all-dancing Gmail behemoth, adding a bunch of features, including personalized emails, automated follow-ups, integration with various CRMs and more. Its collection of Gmail tools are impressive, though its mail merge function doesn't quite have the focus or capabilities to match up against a mail merge-only extension.

**Vocus.io Pricing**

Vocus.io offers three pricing options: Basic, Starter, Professional. Vocus does not offer yearly plans but only monthly plans that can be cancelled anytime. To get the mail merge for Gmail feature, you will need the intermediary Starter plan starting at $10 per month.

**Vocus.io Features**

- Email tracking
- Templates & Snippets
- Send Later & Snooze
