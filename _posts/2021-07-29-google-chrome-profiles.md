If you are using multiple Google accounts, for example you use on the same computer your personal account and your business account, you should definitely consider using Google Chrome profiles. It's a powerful feature available in Google Chrome for years. Here’s what you’ll learn in this guide:

- [How to create a Google Chrome profile](#how-to-create-a-google-chrome-profile)
- [How to switch from one Google Chrome profile to another](#how-to-switch-from-one-google-chrome-profile-to-another)
- [How to remove a Google Chrome profile?](#how-to-manage-your-google-chrome-profile)

## How to create a Google Chrome profile

1.  Click on your profile icon (at the top right corner of your browser).

    ![Open Google Chrome profiles manager from the profile icon](/assets/img/blog/howto-google-chrome-profiles/open-google-chrome-profiles.png){:class="no-shadow"}{:width="600px" height="215px"}

    Watch out, if you are on a Google site, like in Google Sheets, you might see your profile pictures twice. Remember to click on the upper profile picture. Not the lower one.

2.  Now, click on "**+ Add**".

4.  Follow the steps to sign in with your other Google account.

5.  When asked to turn on sync, click on “**Yes, I’m in**”. This will give you an enhanced experience with Google Chrome (passwords, history, etc. will be the same everywhere you use your account).

By following these steps, you have created a new dedicated Google Chrome profile. By doing so, you can now switch from one account to another in 2 clicks. Here's how to do it:
