## Sending 10,000 emails with Gmail

If you’re an email marketer and you’ve got a full email campaign you’re getting ready to roll out, sometimes you’ll want to send huge numbers of emails all at the same time to different potential customers. Mass emailing like this can be a real effort unless you have a Gmail mass email extension that can handle it for you.

The reason for this is that Gmail has a daily limit on how many emails can get sent out in a day – how many emails can be sent at once in Gmail?

- If you’re a free Gmail user, the daily limit is 500 emails a day.
- If you’re a Google Workspace user, the daily limit is 2,000 emails a day.

![Gmail sending limits](/assets/img/blog/how-to-send-mass-emails-gmail/gmail-limits.png){:width="600px" height="663px"}

**So how do you send mass personalized emails to 10,000 recipients?** Well, if you’re using Mailmeteor, the process is remarkably simple using the [Autopilot](/blog/autopilot) feature.

  <figcaption>Send 10,000 with Gmail using the Autopilot</figcaption>
</figure>

All it comes down to is following the same process as above – installing the Mailmeteor extension, creating a contact list, building a template, previewing the emails and sending them off. **Mailmeteor’s handy Autopilot function will automatically send your mass email up to your daily limit over the course of several days** – letting you send all of your emails with just one click.

Pretty neat, right?

## Sending bulk email without getting blocked

If you’re a mass email sender, you’ll know how important it is that your mass email marketing strategy doesn’t get you blocked by email service providers.

So if you’re finding that your [bulk email campaigns in Gmail](/bulk-emails-gmail) are getting you blocked, it’s time to take action. The best way to send mass email in Gmail without getting into any trouble is by sticking to the following guidelines:

1.  **Warm up your account**

    ![Warm-up your Gmail account](/assets/img/blog/how-to-send-mass-emails-gmail/warm-up-mass-emails.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

    Sending a mass email as soon as you’ve opened your Gmail account is a bad idea. ‘Cold’ accounts, or accounts that have never sent an email before, are often flagged up by spam filters as being spammy and possibly fraudulent, so it’s always a good idea to warm up your account before you get started. This means you should send just a few emails to a small list of recipients to begin with – as time goes by, you can start to grow those numbers to your full contact list to ensure you make it past the inbox filters.

2.  **Personalize your emails**

    ![Send mass personalized emails in Gmail](/assets/img/blog/how-to-send-mass-emails-gmail/mass-personalized-emails.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

    Personalization often acts as a clear sign to email service providers that you are sending relevant emails that will be of interest to your recipient. Contacts will be far more likely to open your mass personalized emails too, and that extra open rate will ensure you stay in the good books of providers.

    Personalization is easy with an extension like Mailmeteor, whose features include personalization options sourced directly from your Google Sheets contact list.

3.  **Clean up your contact list**

    ![Keep your address list clean and up to date](/assets/img/blog/how-to-send-mass-emails-gmail/email-verification.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

    Believe it or not, your contact list can have a big impact on your email deliverability rates. Sometimes contact lists can have email addresses on them that no longer exist. Emails sent to these accounts will bounce, and if Gmail sees that too many of your emails are getting bounced, they’ll flag your account for spammy activity and you might get blocked.

    So, carry out contact list maintenance regularly by checking through each of your addressees to ensure they’re all still active.

4.  **Review your email copy**

    ![Review your email copy](/assets/img/blog/how-to-send-mass-emails-gmail/review-email-copy.png){:width="600px" height="325px"}

    The content in your email is one of the first things that spam filters will look at, so it’s always worth taking the extra steps to ensure that your emails are the kind that will make it into an inbox safe and sound.

    From including an unsubscribe link and implementing personalization, to using the same color font and making use of a [spam checker](/spam-checker), there are a number of ways you can keep things clean. So that was our guide to sending mass emails with Gmail! Mailmeteor remains the top-rated mass mail merge extension on Gmail, loved by millions of clients across the globe for its ease-of-use, its raft of handy features and its dedication to the privacy of its users.

5.  **Stagger mass communications over several days**

    ![Avoid sending too many emails at once](/assets/img/blog/how-to-send-mass-emails-gmail/stagger-mass-emails.png){:width="600px" height="398px"}

    It's a best pratice not to send all your emails at once in a single blast. Of course it's tempting to send one large mass mailing to get faster results.
