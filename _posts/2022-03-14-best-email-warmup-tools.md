When you become serious about emailing, one thing you want to prevent is that your emails end up in spam. But how can you make sure your emails don’t land up in the spam folder? Warming up your email account may be the solution.

Email warmup has been trending lately in the email industry. When you start diving into email outreach best practices, you will likely be advised to warm up your email account to increase your email deliverability, in other words: increase your chances to end up in the primary inbox folder.

More and more companies are offering email warmup tools and it’s becoming hard to pick one. We’ve written this guide to help you understand what email warmup really is, how to do it properly and pick the right warmup tool (should you actually need one).

Here’s what you’ll learn in this guide:

- what is warming up an email?
- why use an email warm up service? (and do you need one?)
- what is the best email warmup tool?
- how to warm up your email for free?

Before we dive into the details, here is a foretaste of our ranking.

**Best email warmup tools in 2022**

1. [Mailreach](#1-mailreach)
2. [AutoWarmer by QuickMail](#2-autowarmer-by-quickmail)
3. [Folderly](#3-folderly)
4. [Lemwarm by Lemlist](#4-lemwarm-by-lemlist)
5. [Warmbox](#5-warmbox)
6. [Warmup Inbox](#6-warmup-inbox)
7. [Mailwarm](#7-mailwarm)
8. [Email Warmup by GMass](#8-email-warmup-by-gmass)
9. [OutreachBin](#9-outreachbin)
10. [Warm Up Your Email by MailShake](#10-warm-up-your-email-by-mailshake)

Find out more on how and why we ranked these warm up tools in this order below.

## 1. What is warming up an email?

**Email warm up is the process of gaining the trust of an email provider over time.**

Think of it like a work-out session: before lifting heavy weights or running a long distance, you will prepare your body with low-intensity exercises for 5 to 10 minutes. It’s the same for your email account.

Email service providers such as Gmail, Outlook or Yahoo have implemented strong spam filters. They will [check your emails for spam words](/spam-checker), filter out anything that seems unsolicited and ensure that your email activity looks normal. If you start sending hundreds of emails from a brand new email account, you will end up in spam pretty quickly.

![Email activity](/assets/img/blog/warm-up-tools/email-activity.png)

Thus, **it's a best practice to warm up your email account before starting to send a lot of emails**, to make sure your emails are well received by your recipients.

Now, you may wonder what email warmup means in concrete words?

<div class="blogpost-note">
  <p class="font-weight-bold">Email warmup consists in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sending a limited amount of emails per day</li>
    <li>Increasing the number of emails you send and receive progressively</li>
    <li>Keeping your email activity steady and avoid big bumps or long pauses</li>
    <li>Having real conversations that make sense, with real people: replying to emails, exchanging attachments, calendar invitations...</li>
    <li>Marking emails as not spam, opening the emails, marking them as important</li>
    <li>In other words, using your mailbox like a real human!</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Warming up your email helps build your email address reputation. As your email and domain build trust, spam filters will consider your account as trustworthy. **That way, your emails won't end up in spam.**

_Note: Email warmup is also sometimes called IP warmup. To dive into technical details, when you send emails you can use a dedicated IP address. It's a feature commonly offered by email marketing platforms. When using a dedicated IP, your emails are sent from a single domain that is not shared with other users. It might sound counterintutive, but dedicated IPs are not necessarly better for email deliverabilty, unless you warm up your IP address using an IP warm up service. Indeed, shared IPs might have a better IP reputation as they are older and more reliable than a newly created IP that is not warmed up._

## 2. Should you use an email warm up service?

There are two ways to warm up your email account. Either you can do it manually or use a dedicated email warmup service that will do the job for you.

### Email warmup: the manual way

**It is possible to warm up your email manually, but it is a difficult process that will take time**.

You’ll need to send emails repeatedly each day and make sure that people you contact respond to you. That’s because getting a high reply-rate is one of the key factors to gain email reputation.

But you won’t gain much reputation if you regularly send emails from let’s say your professional email address to your personal one (and vice-versa). Your reputation score depends on multiple criteria. The reply-rate, which is just one factor amongst many others, takes into account how many different email addresses you get replies from. Worst, most advanced algorithms, also take into account the reputation of the email address that replies to you.

Think of it a little bit like the Pagerank algorithms in SEO. The best ranked websites that link to your own website, send you more domain reputation than spammy websites.

Therefore, manual email warming takes time and many efforts. That’s why so many warmup solutions have taken the leap. And given the quality of the automated inbox warming options available, warming your account manually isn’t the greatest use of your time.

### Email warmup: using an email warmup service

Otherwise, you can use an email warmup service to do this process automatically.

**Email warm up tools will connect to your email inbox and do the warm up for you over several weeks**. Their service ensures that your email activity will be consistent with high engagement rates.

**How do email warmup tools work behind the scenes?**

Email warm up tools use different methods for warming emails.

Some email warmup services will make your address interact with other members from their user base, that’s how [Lemwarm](#4-lemwarm-by-lemlist) or [GMass](#8-email-warmup-by-gmass) work for example. Your account will be sending emails to other users and will reply to their incoming emails. It might cause some privacy issues as you may not want your address to be interacting with other real users from your email warmup service.

Other services have built a network of email addresses entirely dedicated to the purpose of warming up emails (such as [Mailwarm](#7-mailwarm) or [Warmbox](#5-warmbox)). Of course, this has also disadvantages because this network isn’t constituted of email addresses used by real people. It's only a computer generated network and you can't know for sure that anti-spam filters won't be able to catch this method.

When it comes to the actual content email warm up tools send from your inbox, it varies depending on the service you use. Some warm up tools use human and unique email copy in each of your warming emails. Others will stuff the warming emails with random words that may look less natural (even though these warm up tools promise that it will still be enough to trick anti-spam filters).

### Do I need to warmup my email?

If you’re really serious about email deliverability, then using an email warm up service might be worth trying. Why? It will help you warm up your account faster. That's useful if you have several inboxes for email outreach and want to test ideas in quick manner. In other cases, email warmup can also help you recover from a bad sender reputation.

Still, keep in mind that an email warmup tool is not the panacea for all your email deliverability issues.

**You will achieve great results, just by making sure you actually follow our essential [email deliverability guidelines](/blog/gmail-deliverability).**

<div class="blogpost-note">
  <p>Note that if you have already been using your email account for some time, and you’re not sending a lot of cold emails, you don’t necessarily need to use such email warmup solutions. For example, if you own a Gmail account that you've been using frequently for the past few months, there is no specific need to use an email warm up tool.

## 3. Top 10 of the best email warm up tools

We have tested for you all the email warm up software available online and picked the 10 best cold email warm up services in 2022. We ranked them according to several factors, including:

- **Email Warm Up method**: do they make your account interact with other users from their database, a network of computer generated mailboxes or a mix of both?
- **Email Warm Up focused**: are these companies focused on email warmup or do they just offer warm up service to appeal customers?
- **Warm Up Features**: what differentiating functionalities do these tools offer?
- **Pricing & Free trial**: how much do email warmup tools cost and do they offer a free trial?
- **Customer reviews**, from trusted platforms such as Capterra or G2
- **User experience**: are these warm up tools easy to navigate and understand?
- **Privacy**: do these companies emphasize the protection of your data?

Let's get started:

### 1. Mailreach

**What is Mailreach and how does it work?**

Mailreach is a French company created in 2020. It's a latecomer in the email warm up industry but they already demonstrated a solid execution.

Why rank Mailreach #1? Among all the email warm up tools we tested, Mailreach standed out for a few key reasons: it's an independant email warmup service, built entirely for that purpose. You can use Mailreach in a standalone way and the platform is solely focused on building a solid warm up tool. Mailreach offers a fully automated warm up for an affordable price. It's not the least expensive solution, however you get access to a fair amount of features as well as a dedicated support.

![Mailreach screenshot](/assets/img/blog/warm-up-tools/mailreach.png)

To mention a few interesting features: the fact that you can connect multiple ESP (Google, Outlook...), test your emails and get a spam score as well as monitor that your email isn't blacklisted. It's worth mentioning that Mailreach's user interface is simple to navigate. The overall design is cleaner than most warm up solutions we tested.

On the downside, Mailreach has been using a network of computer generated mailboxes to warm up your emails, instead of interacting with other real users. For some, it's an advantage. However, we may argue that anti-spam filters might identify this technique in the future. Even though your mailbox won't be exchanging with real users, the email content that Mailreach sends for you is meant to be human and meaningful. Indeed, other warm up tools may just send some random gibberish content to fill in your warm up emails. Mailreach is now using more and more its peer-to-peer network to warm up your email, so that your mailbox will be exchanging with other real users.

**Mailreach features**

- 1 email account to warm up
- Fully automated warm up
- Up to 90 emails / day
- Smart warming algorithm
- Deliverability correction
- Advanced Spam tester with insights
- Multiple ESP warm up (Google, Outlook, etc.)
- Monitoring dashboard
- Live blacklists and DNS check ups
- Chat support

**Mailreach pricing**

Mailreach costs $25 per email account. They also offer custom plans for enterprises. There is no free trial on Mailreach.

If your emails are ever detected in the spam filter, they will be automatically marked as 'not spam' and transferred to the main inbox to minimize the chance that it happens again. After a short time, you will be able to prove to ESPs (email service providers) that you are a reliable sender who sends and receives real emails, making them less likely to report your email campaigns as spam.
