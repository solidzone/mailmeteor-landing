          Constant Contact is a leading marketing suite for businesses looking to expand – but are there
          <a href="/best-google-apps/mail-merge-gmail">better mail merge alternatives</a>?
        </p>
        <p>
          An established name in the online marketing business, Constant Contact was originally founded as Roving Software back in 1995. Led by founder Gail F. Goodman, the
          business has developed and evolved to be one of the best and most trusted digital marketing toolkits in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Backed by a number of acquisitions through the years, including NutshellMail, Bantam Live and Single Platform, Constant Contact offers a comprehensive set of tools to
          drive sales and engagement for small-to-medium businesses. From eCommerce and website-building, to social marketing and email capabilities, there’s a lot going on here to
          keep professionals on the go.
        </p>
        <p>
          For email marketing, Constant Contact features a mail editor that’s driven by automation, with built-in features to help it drive business to eCommerce shop fronts. It’s
          a powerful tool that has a lot going for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="font-weight-bold"
            >Despite this, Constant Contact does come with a big price tag for all of the features it has to offer, and more importantly, it charges based on the number of contacts
            you have</span
          >. That means that the more you scale your business, the more you’ll pay for using Constant Contact. Another disadvantage is that targeted personalized emails aren’t the
          priority here – which can leave your mail merges with a less human touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          An excellent alternative to Constant Contact for those looking for a reliable and straightforward mail merge that quickly integrates with Google Workplace is
          <a href="/">Mailmeteor</a>. The highest-rated mail merge tool on the Google Marketplace, Mailmeteor offers a powerful mail merge for just $9.99 a month or for $49.99 a
          year. That price includes a <a href="/features">full suite of features</a> for reaching more recipients than ever, including personalization, email tracking, scheduling
          and autopilot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mailmeteor requires only the most basic of permissions to operate – guaranteeing your privacy and safety while you reach out to your contacts. Our leading mail merge tool
          is used by millions of users and professionals across all kinds of industries for accessing recipient lists in the hundreds.

              This is the best G-Suite mail system I've used, and it actually makes high-touch emailing at scale easier than dedicated email platforms. There's just no mystery -
              oh, look, a list of people in spreadsheet...merge...send. Setting up Zapier triggers to keep Google Sheets lists up-to-date (new prospect, new lead for this, for
              that) really helps tap the power-of-simplicity engineered into Mailmeteor. Fantastic pricing approach too - complete no-brainer if you're growing your list. As a long
              time user of emailing platforms, I find this is a great alternative to ConstantContact, Mailchimp & others!
