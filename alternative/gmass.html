          There are many <strong>mail merge add-ons</strong> available, this short guide will help you to pick the best
          <a href="/best-google-apps/mail-merge-gmail">mail merge extension</a> to replace GMass.
        </p>
        <p>
          GMass is an email marketing plugin for sending mail merge campaigns inside Gmail.
          <strong>Gmass.co</strong> offers a Google Chrome extension and a Gmail add-on to send mass emails, however the experience may lack simplicity and the price is overall
          quite expensive compared to similar solutions like Mailmeteor. Until recently, a <strong>GMass footer</strong> was included by default in the
          <strong>free version of GMass</strong>, which degraded the quality of your email campaigns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mailmeteor is the best-rated mail merge addon for Gmail. In its free version, Mailmeteor offers more free quota than GMass (75 emails in Mailmeteor vs 50 in GMass) which
          is a good option if you’re looking for a
          <strong>free GMass alternative</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, Mailmeteor offers plans that are much
          <strong>more affordable than GMass pricing</strong>, for individuals and companies, which you can find in the table below. On November 15th 2021, GMass raised its pricing
          for all plans. It will cost you $200 per year to benefit from GMass standard features. While GMass offers tons of side features, most users may feel that pricing has
          become too steep for extra functionnalities they will never use.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case you need help, GMass is a self-service system which means that you will have to pay to get premium support from the GMass team. Mailmeteor offers premium support
          under 24h in three languages without no extra fees.

              [...] The other tool that I tried was GMass. It felt a lot more complicated. I didn't like that I had to install two pieces to get it to work - an extension to my
              Chrome browser plus an add-on to Gmail. Each of those added buttons which are there all the time. Then I wasn't able to preview the merge to make sure that my merge
              fields worked correctly. What I liked about Mailmeteor is that I could send emails in a few minutes, using the tools I'm already familiar with. It felt very natural
              to me.
