          One of the first of its kind, Gmelius is a fully-functioning collaboration platform that integrates with and lives inside the Google Workplace. Designed to help
          professional teams connect on the go, this relatively new extension continues to impress, with a serious focus on improving efficiency at every level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded in Geneva, Switzerland by founder Florian Bersier, Gmelius has teams in Europe and the US, all centered on delivering team-working solutions that allow businesses
          to upgrade their ways of working. Still in the startup phase, the Gmelius team is backed by US tech startup accelerator Y Combinator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gmelius’ integration with the Gmail model makes it a good choice for many, requiring little knowledge to get up and running and needing little introduction for new
          members. The suite contains very handy features that are designed to improve collaboration – features such as a shared inbox, meeting schedulers, shared Gmail labels and
          Kanban boards. Automated workflows, email sharing, <a href="/mail-merge-gmail">mail merge</a> and email tracking are also part of the Gmelius eco-system for a complete
          <a href="/best-google-apps">Google Workplace solution</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >One of the problems with Gmelius however, especially for those looking for just a quick and efficient mail merge solution, is that you would need to incorporate
            Gmelius’ features in every part of your work</strong
          >
          – this is because your mail merge contacts would have to be hosted on the software itself. As well as that, mail merges aren’t the core focus of Gmelius, and can lack the
          many features that other mail merges offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a simple email solution, <strong>an excellent alternative to Gmelius is <a href="/">Mailmeteor</a></strong
