        When it comes to picking out the right cold email software for you and your business, there’s a whole lot of options for you to choose from. Lemlist quickly became one of
        the most prominent out there, but where should you look if Lemlist isn’t quite working for you (too costly, too complicated)? In this brief guide, we’re going to match
        Lemlist up against Mailmeteor, one of the leading
        <strong>Lemlist competitors</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lemlist is a comprehensive piece of full-service outreach software, combining your sales automation and cold email software in one. Lemlist helps businesses of all sizes to
        personalize cold emails, automate follow-ups, and engage with leads across all channels. Lemlist founder and CEO Guillaume Moubeche has done an excellent job creating an
        industry-leading emailing platform with his team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created in 2017, Lemlist is a popular choice for growth hackers and salespeople as the Lemlist reviews indicate. But for many, the Lemlist pricing plans, and a sometimes
        overwhelming range of features, can be a turn-off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people found Lemlist hard to navigate after its January 2021 redesign, while others still believe the Lemlist interface is what makes it unique as a platform. If you
        are looking for a simpler solution, the good news is that there’s a leading
        <strong>Lemlist free alternative</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In just three years, Mailmeteor has become the
        <a href="https://mailmeteor.com/best-google-apps/mail-merge-gmail" target="_blank">best-rated mail merge</a>
        addon for Gmail, providing both individuals and professionals access to a simple, privacy-focused and powerful emailing solution. Think of Mailmeteor as an essential email
        toolkit that covers all of the bases, whereas Lemlist could be too complex and costly for your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lemlist pricing starts at $59 per month. With Mailmeteor, you can start sending emails for as low as $8.99 per month. Better yet, as a Lemlist alternative, Mailmeteor
        features a completely free trial subscription plan for those on a budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what makes Mailmeteor the
        <strong>best alternative to Lemlist?</strong>

            I have tried a lot. Mailmeteor is simple in it's interface, but what it does, it does really well. It has the highest amount of emails you can send for free compared to
            Lemlist. If you prefer working out of the spreadsheet and want to avoid a complex & costly platform, I definitely recommend looking at Mailmeteor!
