      <p style="font-weight: 600; margin: 1rem 0">
        Mailchimp has long been one of the most popular email marketing tools. In September 2021, Mailchimp made headlines after Intuit acquired it for 12 billion dollars (yes, you
        read that right!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Mailchimp was born more than 20 years ago at a time when email marketing was not such a thing. It revolutionized the emailing industry with a simple user experience at that
        time. Anyone who used Mailchimp back in the days can remember their iconic chimpanzee!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as Mailchimp grew over the two past decades, it became quite expensive and overly-complicated to use, packed with all kinds of features that you’ll pay for but
        won’t necessarily use. So what
        <strong>Mailchimp alternatives</strong> are there for those looking for something a little bit more straightforward? In this article, we’re going to see how Gmail add-on
        Mailmeteor lines up against Mailchimp and what benefits it brings to the table.
      </p>
      <h2>Mailchimp pricing and plans comparison</h2>
      <p>
        Mailchimp’s pricing is split into four different levels of subscription – it starts with the Mailchimp free package which includes things like a marketing CRM and a website
        builder, before rising to the essentials plan which suits smaller businesses a little bit better.
      </p>
      <p>
        From here, you can upgrade to the standard plan which features some automation and analytics, or the highest level of subscription, which is the premium plan containing the
        full width and breadth of the Mailchimp features and service list.
      </p>
      <p>
        While at first glance, this features list seems like it covers a lot of content all in one price, the truth is that for most users, you might not use even half of all of
        the features. This is especially true for those needing a simple tool for sending newsletters or those with bigger contact lists.
      </p>

      </video>
      <p>
        As you can see, Mailchimp's pricing can quickly become really expensive depending on the number of contacts you have. Nowadays, if you aren’t managing the marketing
        department for a large business, Mailchimp may prove to be a bit too overwhelming for the price.
      </p>
      <h2>The best free alternative to Mailchimp</h2>
      <p>
        If you don’t want to be limited on the number of contacts you can email, or if you are just looking for a simple emailing solution to compete with the chimp, let us
        introduce you to
        <strong>Mailmeteor as a best alternative to Mailchimp</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mailmeteor is a focused email toolkit that provides all of the essentials for those looking for reliable and scalable email solutions. Mailmeteor’s more approachable nature
        makes it perfect for both everyday users and professionals, not just for marketing executives, providing the necessary features through an easy-to-use platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Better yet,
        <a href="https://support.mailmeteor.com/help/privacy">your privacy is protected with Mailmeteor</a>. Mailmeteor only requires the most minimal permissions to send emails on
        your behalf, unlike more advanced platforms that might require more personal information and data. In comparison to what Mailchimp reviews say, it’s thanks to this focus on
        privacy and its simplicity that Mailmeteor has become the <a href="/gmail-mail-merge">best Gmail mail merge tool</a> to send mass personalized emails.
