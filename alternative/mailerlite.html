        <p class="font-semibold my-3">
          As a email marketing platform, MailerLite is an effective tool suite that suits many
          <a href="/gmail-marketing">email campaigns and strategies</a> thanks to its extensive, business-orientated feature list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded in 2009 in Vilnius, Lithuania, the suite has a focus on creating impactful emails to attract new audiences and raise brand awareness. Its email solution continues
          to help business harness the power of email as a means of marketing communication. When comparing MailerLite vs Mailchimp or other email platforms, Quickmail stands out
          by delivering emails in more targeted approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with many other marketing-focused email tool suites however, you can often end up paying more for extra Mailerlite features that you don’t need.
          <span class="font-weight-bold"
            >This is especially true of MailerLite pricing which charges on the number of subscribers you have. The more your audience grows, the more you’ll have to pay</span
          >. With this in mind, if you’re a smaller business, or if you are in need of a mail merge that works for personal tasks, then most of what MailerLite has to offer may not
          be what you’re looking for – especially considering that MailerLite isn’t quite adapted for targeted personalized emails that can get past spam filters.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need a simpler, less feature-heavy tool, focused on efficient mail merging, there might be better <strong>alternatives to MailerLite</strong> out there for you.
          One of those options is <a href="/">Mailmeteor</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top-rated <a href="/mail-merge-gmail/extensions">mail merge extension</a> on the Google Marketplace, Mailmeteor makes creating and scheduling mail merges for large
          groups of contacts quicker and easier than ever before. Boasting a range of features, such as personalization, deliverability tools and tracking capabilities,
          Mailmeteor’s capabilities are ideal to help you reach your intended audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with all of the above benefits, Mailmeteor also keeps your information secure by only asking for the most basic of permissions to operate, putting your privacy
          first with every email campaign.
