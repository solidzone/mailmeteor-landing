          Businesses and individuals across the internet use email outreach to turn cold prospects into warm leads. Mailshake is an example of a mail merge tool that makes this job
          that much easier – but where should you turn to if Mailkshake isn’t getting the job done? In our quick guide, we’re going to introduce a best alternative to Mailshake
          that works for your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built for sales purposes, Mailshake is an
          <strong>email outreach tool</strong> with a raft of dynamic features that use automation to create email marketing campaigns. With workflow simplification options, data
          reports and other tools, Mailshake provides sales teams with software that establishes relationships with potential customers and seeks to accrue engagement and
          conversions through one single dashboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based and founded in Austin, Texas, Mailshake is a good choice for sales teams of different sizes, with features tailored to that side of email marketing – however,
          similar to other email sales add-ons, Mailshake has a great deal of features that simply aren’t needed by those who aren’t focused on sales. An over-abundance of sales
          tools can be difficult to navigate for those looking for a no-frills mail merge tool that gets the job done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, for users like these, there is a great
          <strong>Mailshake alternative</strong> – and it’s called Mailmeteor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mailmeteor has gone from strength to strength in just three years, becoming Google’s
          <a href="https://mailmeteor.com/best-google-apps/mail-merge-gmail" target="_blank">best-rated mail merge for Gmail</a>
          add-on and accruing over 3 million downloads in that time alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          With powerful, yet simple-to-use, features that are designed to make mail merging an easy task, Mailmeteor has personalization tools and attachment capabilities that are
          perfect for users of all technical abilities. Where Mailshake’s tools are designed for salespeople and marketers, Mailmeteor’s entirely mail merge focused add-on is for
          individuals and professionals alike, with a much cheaper set of pricing plans to suit everyone!
