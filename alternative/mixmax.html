          An American software business based out of San Francisco, Mixmax is a sales engagement platform built around <a href="/best-google-apps/gmail">Gmail</a> focused on
          maximizing efficiency for businesses. A major player in the industry, Mixmax boasts over 50 employees in its business, all dedicated to creating a full eco-system of
          sales engagement tools for small-to-medium businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          A wealth of features makes this a tempting choice for most businesses. Smart messaging makes communication a breeze, recruitment functions make reaching out to new
          talented quick and easy, and sales analytics complete the picture of a toolkit for modern sales management. Designed mainly for CSMs and AEs, Mixmax continues to impress
          the professional community with easy-to-use tools that offer powerful functionality at every level.
        </p>

          The Mixmax product upgrades the sales functionalities when it comes to Gmail, including things like automation and scheduling to keep businesses’ email campaigns on the
          move. It’s worth noting however that the price of subscription can rise quite high – if you’re just looking for just a mail merge solution, you can end up paying up to
          $24 a month with Mixmax – and that’s just for the basic email features.
        </p>

          <strong>For those looking for a dedicated Mixmax alternative that suits a range of budgets, <a href="/">Mailmeteor</a></strong> is the answer. For just $9.99 a month or
          $49.99 a year, this powerful <a href="/mail-merge-gmail/extensions">mail merge extension</a> is the highest-rated on Google Marketplace, trusted by over 3 million
          professionals around the world. Built around privacy and requiring only the minimum of requirements to operate, Mailmeteor is a leading mail merge tool that includes

              item in an easy and organized manner. I probably spend 90% less time on repetitive email tasks than before.
