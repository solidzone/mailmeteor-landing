          As an emailing platform, QuickMail has a lot to offer for its convenience, its efficiency and its reliability – but is there a better alternative?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>QuickMail</strong> has over a decade of history helping users reach big audiences and to guarantee replies with automated follow-ups. Working with most of the
          main email providers, including Gmail and Microsoft Outlook, this extension is a heritage choice that provides an excellent array of functions. When comparing Quickmail
          vs Mailchimp or other email platforms, Quickmail stands out by delivering emails in more targeted approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its dedicated focus towards small businesses does restrict it for many other users however. Those who are looking for an accessible mail merge for everyday or personal
          use may find that many of the features aren’t necessary for what they need to do. Things like <strong>automation, Quickmail autowarmer and A/B tracking</strong> may be a
          worthwhile investment for businesses, but the extra cost might not be what general users are looking for. And that cost can add up – beyond the limited free version,
          prices start at $49 a month which can be a lot for a package that provides just the essentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          One <span class="font-weight-bold">excellent alternative to Quickmail is Mailmeteor</span>, as it can fit the needs of individuals, businesses and large organizations
