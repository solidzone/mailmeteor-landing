          As a sales suite, Saleshandy is a leading solution that shines, but as a <a href="/mail-merge-gmail/">mail merge</a>, there may well be better, more focused and more
          efficient options available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded by co-founders Piyush Patel and Dhruv Patel in Ahmedabad, India, Saleshandy is an <a href="/gmail-marketing">email marketing</a> sales platform that places a big
          focus on sales automation. With over five years of development under their belt, they promise 10x the engagement for email campaigns, helping to narrow down potential
          leads and prospects through a range of handy features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this, the Saleshandy feature list can often be too much for many users. With so many different functions on offer, many will find that they won’t need half of
          what’s on offer – and the since it’s those unrequired features that drive up the price,
          <strong>users may find they’re paying for elements they’ll never end up using</strong>. Their most popular option, the Plus model, costs $22 a month, which may be a
          stretch too far for those looking for the email essentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s where <a href="/">Mailmeteor</a> comes in! Unlike Saleshandy, Mailmeteor has a single focus – it does the basics really, really well. A dedicated
          <a href="/mail-merge-gmail/extensions">mail merge extension</a> for Gmail, <strong>Mailmeteor combines a number of must-have features</strong> into one easy-to-use
          interface that gets your mail merges up and running in no time. Personalization, improved email deliverability, email tracking and mail merge scheduling are just some of
          the tools available to you – and with a single monthly package at $9.99 a month, you’re getting exceptional value for money! Plus, even though Saleshandy can be
          considered safe, you might want to opt for a solution like Mailmeteor that only needs minimal permissions from you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Best of all, you’re in good company. Mailmeteor is used by over <a href="/reviews">3 million professionals and business</a> across the globe for all of their mail merge
          needs – more importantly, it’s the <strong>top-rated mail merge extension</strong> on the Gmail marketplace.
