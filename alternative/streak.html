          For anyone looking to reach hundreds and even thousands of recipients with just one click, there are many
          <a href="/best-google-apps/mail-merge-gmail">mail merge options</a> like Streak that can fit your needs. But is it the best?
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded back in 2011, Streak is a customer relationship management platform designed for Gmail, giving a complete set of features that makes reaching your customers
          quick, easy and efficient. Its founder, Aleem Mawani, worked at Google as a product manager, and when he started Streak Chrome extension, he brought many of his insights
          to develop a winning formula for businesses looking to expand through Gmail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="/gmail-mail-merge">mail merge</a> function of Streak is only a recent addition to the platform, launched in October 2021. While it does the job, it isn’t the
          main function of the extension. Because of this, its extensive feature list can be a step too far for many users who just need a reliable and effective mail merge that
          does the job. The CRM features also drive up the price of the extension, with the Pro package starting at $49 –
          <span class="font-weight-bold">so you might find you’re paying for more than you need</span>.
        </p>
        <p>

          simple Google sheets integration, email tracking, scheduling and more to give you a full wealth of possibilities when reaching multiple contacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Better yet, privacy is of the highest priority – Mailmeteor will only ask for the most basic of permissions to operate, keeping your personal information safe and secure
          while you craft your mail merges.
