          Vocus.io is full stack email outreach platform, with an extensive range of capabilities. Vocus keeps its users on the go – though for
          <a href="/gmail-marketing">email marketing</a>, other options might have more to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded back in 2016, Vocus.IO is a versatile piece of email software, split into three products all shared on the same platform. Based in Washington, the Vocus.io
          extension packs a lot of punch into one offering that can help you manage email campaigns across the board.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vocus.IO offers three products including a multifunctional inbox, a vocus calendar and a campaign toolkit. Each one providing something a little bit different to grant
          complete control over organization and email management. For that extra convenience, it can also integrate with a number of other bits of business software including
          Zoom, Salesforce, Hubspot and Zoho.
        </p>
        <p>
          However if you’re looking for a simple, effective, reliable and affordable tool that helps you reach multiple email contacts with just one click, then other alternatives
          to Vocus.IO can do the job much quicker and with far less effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>One of these alternatives is <a href="/">Mailmeteor</a></strong
          >, the top-rated <a href="/mail-merge-gmail/">mail merge</a> tool on Google Marketplace. Users love Mailmeteor as an extension thanks to its simple and intuitive toolset
          that focuses on making the mail merge process as easy as possible. A clean interface and effortless integration with the rest of the Google Suite makes Mailmeteor a
          leading choice for many – but behind the face of the platform lie some exceptionally powerful features, all designed to help your emails land in the inboxes of audiences
          of all sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a monthly price of $9.99, Mailmeteor is one of the most popular email outreach platform out there – giving you tried-and-tested functionality for a budget-friendly
          price.
