          Choosing an email outreach tool is all about knowing and researching your options. Some tools are better for professionals, some for individuals, and others for
          businesses. So tracking down one that fits your specification is crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Woodpecker is a great email marketing platforms out there, leading the way with an expertise in cold email outreach. It’s ideal for sales and marketing professionals who
          are looking to increase their replies from prospects. Woodpecker prides itself with a unique algorithm for maximizing
          <a href="/blog/gmail-deliverability">email deliverability</a>. Woodpecker does, however, come with a high price tag, and its feature list may not be the best for those
          looking for simpler and more targeted email services.
        </p>
        <p>
          So if Woodpecker doesn’t quite work for your needs, where should you turn? In this article, we’re going to take a look at Mailmeteor,
          <span>one of the best Woodpecker alternatives</span> on the market.
        </p>
        <h2>Woodpecker pricing: is it worth the money?</h2>
        <p>
          Introduced in 2015 as an email marketing automation tool, Woodpecker is ideal for marketing professionals looking to send out automated email campaigns to clients and
          customers. Focusing mainly on the B2B (business-to-business) market, this tool features a range of services designed to help salespeople personalize their email content
          to add a more human touch to their cold-email outreach. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/woodpeckerapp/reviews" rel="noreferrer noopener">Woodpecker reviews</a> also
          give a clear idea of the quality of the add-on.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Woodpecker pricing starts at $39 per month</strong>. But for that price, you only get 50 recipients a day! This is understable as Woodpecker positions itself as a
          cold email platform, however it may not be adapted for anyone other than advanced sales users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform itself is also designed for professionals, working in integrated marketing divisions. For startups and personal users, the raft of features can be daunting
          to use and many might not even be needed for the price you pay.
        </p>
        <p>So what’s the alternative? Well, Mailmeteor is a solution well-worth exploring.</p>
        <h2>Mailmeteor: the best alternative to Woodpecker</h2>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>

          inbox and get more replies.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also great to note that Mailmeteor is one of <a href="https://support.mailmeteor.com/help/privacy">the most privacy-friendly emailing tools</a>
          out there, requiring only the most minimal permissions to operate, unlike other competitors that require access to all your inbox private data.
