          Yesware is a popular emailing platform, with a strong sales focus for businesses. But what about businesses that are focused on brand marketing over sales? Or people
          needing a simpler
          <a href="/gmail-mail-merge" target="_blank">mail merge</a> for personal use? In this short, we’re going to look at one of the best alternatives to Yesware on the market
          today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yesware is one of the market’s best sales software suites, with a primary focus on bringing in more sales with targeted email campaigns. This add-on has features like
          data reporting, email tracking and meeting schedulers that are designed to help sales teams secure conversions and encourage engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded back in 2010 by three sales professionals, Matthew Bellows, Rajat Bhargava and Cashman Andrus, Yesware has a range of benefits that are great for salespeople.
          However, their extensive feature list can be daunting and over-complicated for most users, and their overall focus on sales-based users means that people needing to send
          emails for anything other than sales can feel left out.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those users,
          <strong>Mailmeteor is an excellent Yesware alternative</strong>
          available on the Google Workspace Marketplace, with over 3 million users and thousands of 5-Star reviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mailmeteor is a tool that makes sending mass personalized emails through Gmail simple and straightforward, with a complete set of powerful features designed to suit
          professionals, businesses and individuals right down to the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike Yesware, Mailmeteor is designed for everyone, and its main purpose as a mail merge tool means that it is exceptionally good at its job, with no other distractions
          or complications. Its price plans come in at much cheaper than Yesware too, giving you access to a powerful mail merge add-on that works for your wallet.
