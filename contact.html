      <help-article url="#billing/cancel" title="How to cancel my subscription?" nofooter>
        <p>To cancel your subscription and avoid future payments, follow these simple steps:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Open <a href="https://dashboard.mailmeteor.com">Mailmeteor's dashboard</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://dashboard.mailmeteor.com/account">Go to your Account settings</a></li>
          <li>Scroll down and select "Cancel subscription"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          From there, we will ask you for a few details on why you want to leave us. Then your subscription will be
          automatically cancelled.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can cancel your subscription anytime. If you cancel in advance, you will enjoy your full email quota until
          the last day of your subscription.
        </p>
      </help-article>

      <help-article url="#billing/change-email" title="Can I change my email address?" form nofooter>
        <p>
          Most of the time, people asking for changing of email address have been flagged as spamming or considered
          misusing the platform. So we generally don't change an email address assigned to a subscription.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have just made your purchase and you made a mistake on the email address, that's different of course!
          Contact us and we will manually update your account.
        </p>
      </help-article>

      <help-article url="#billing/upgrade-failed" title="I've purchased Mailmeteor but my account did not upgrade">
        <p>If you've purchased a subscription but still can't access the premium features, try the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Refresh your window and re-open Mailmeteor to see if it updates your account</li>
          <li>
            In Google Sheets, go to the Add-ons menu at the top and check under Mailmeteor > My account that you are
            logged in with the right Google account
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In case the above doesn't help, your issue may come from a typo in your email address during upgrade or a
          temporary issue preventing the upgrade. Please contact us and we will help you solve this situation.

      <help-article
        url="#billing/500-only"
        title="I've purchased Mailmeteor but I can only send 500 emails a day (instead of 2,000)"
      >
        <p>Mailmeteor Premium allows you to send personalized emails up to the limits imposed by Gmail:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Gmail accounts (@gmail.com) can send up to 500 emails per day</li>
          <li>Google Workspace (G Suite) accounts can send up to 2000 emails per day</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Mailmeteor abides by these limits and allows you to send as many emails as you can using your own Gmail
          account. If you upgraded a @gmail.com address, you would need to switch to a Google Workspace account to send
          2000 emails a day.
        </p>

        <p>
          This information is available on our website at the time of purchase, as well as in the pricing section and

          know the old email address and the new one you'd like to use instead.
