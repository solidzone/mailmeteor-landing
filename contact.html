        <p>
          First of all, open Gmail and go to your "Sent" folder to confirm that your emails have been sent or not. If no emails were sent, there might have been an error
          with your campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have scheduled your campaign or sent emails on Autopilot, note that it might take some time for your emails to be sent, as the campaign is sent progressively in
          that case.
        </p>
        <p>To know more about your campaign's situation:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to your Mailmeteor Dashboard</li>
          <li>Select the campaign you want to investigate</li>
          <li>Access the campaign's metrics to understand what caused your emails not to be sent</li>

      <help-article url="#issues/open-mailmeteor" title="I can't open Mailmeteor">
        <p>Your issue might be due to using multiple Google accounts under the same Chrome browser. Google can't handle when multiple accounts are logged in simultaneously.</p>
        <p>
          Since you are using multiple Google accounts we recommend creating a new profile in Google Chrome with the account you are using Mailmeteor with. This will make sure
          it'll always work with the right account. It takes only 1 minute to set up!

      <help-article url="#issues/alias" title="Email alias is not working">
        <p>
          If you are using an email alias but emails are not sending correctly, the main reason might be that your email alias is not well configured in Gmail. Indeed, Mailmeteor
          falls back to your primary email address when your alias is not properly set up.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">How to solve an email alias not working properly:</p>

        <ol>

      <help-article url="#issues/attachments" title="My attachments files are not sent">
        <p>If your attachment is not sending with your emails, it might be due to the file size being too large or a temporary connection issue.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Please make sure your attachment size is below 5MB. You may need to use an online service to compress your files such as a PDF compressor.</li>
          <li>Try to create a new template in Mailmeteor and attach your file again. This might solve a download issue due to a temporary connection loss.</li>

        <p>To refresh your tracking report, please proceed as follow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Close your tracking report window</li>
          <li>In your Google spreadsheet, click on ‚ÄúAdd-ons‚Äù > ‚ÄúMailmeteor‚Äù > ‚ÄúTracking report‚Äù</li>

      <help-article url="#issues/all-emails-opened" title="All my emails are marked as opened">
        <p>
          The tracking system that Mailmeteor uses is industry standard. It works by adding a small image (called a 1x1 pixel) on the bottom of each email you send. Every time
          someone opens your email, it downloads that small image and Mailmeteor records that opening in its database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open tracking depends on email providers. Some email providers are downloading the tracking pixel before a user opens the mail. This is the reason why some emails are
          marked as opened immediately after sending, and some not.
        </p>
        <p>
          This situation can happen when your CRM (Salesfore, Hubspot) is Bcced to log conversations or when all your recipients belong to the same email domain that has specific
          restrictions in place.

      <help-article url="#issues/reached-limit" title="Gmail says ‚ÄúI've reached a limit‚Äù">
        <p>When sending large campaigns, Google may temporarily stop your campaign and tell you have "reached a limit" if it meets one of these conditions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>10 recipients in your campaign marked your email as spam</li>
          <li>10 emails fell into your recipients' spam folder</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">How to solve the ‚Äúreached a limit‚Äù error:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Identify why your emails were blocked by Google. We have detailed our
            <a href="https://support.mailmeteor.com/introduction/quick-start/avoid-spams-filters">guidelines to help you avoid "reached a limit" from Gmail.</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you have identified what may cause this issue, you can resume sending (you could try again tomorrow for example). To resume sending, check what was the first email
            blocked by Google and then filter your spreadsheet to resume the campaign starting from this recipient.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </help-article>

      <help-article url="#issues/blocked" title="My Google account got blocked">
        <p>
          Blocking accounts is the standard Gmail procedure when an unusual activity is detected. For example, if your email campaign has been marked as spam by your contacts.
          Fortunately, it's possible to unblock a Gmail account.
        </p>

        <p class="font-weight-bold">How to unblock your Google account:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Go to the <a href="https://admin.google.com/">Google Admin Panel</a></li>
          <li>In the Users panel, search for the blocked account</li>
          <li>Go to the blocked account profile and click on ‚ÄúReactivate‚Äù</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Having an account blocked can happen to all of us and it doesn't mean your whole domain reputation will be affected negatively. However, take it as a sign that something
          should be reviewed within your email strategy. Google can suspend an account for good if it still doesn't respect its guidelines.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be sure to follow our
          <a href="https://support.mailmeteor.com/introduction/sending-guidelines">sending guidelines</a> to avoid your Google account being blocked again. Please note Mailmeteor
          anti-abuse algorithms might also block your account in case we detect a suspicious activity.
