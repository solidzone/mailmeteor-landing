            <p>With each merger, only a subset of information are stored in our secure
                servers.
                Such information are called metadata and contain the followings: </p>
            <ul class="c12 lst-kix_6kf186bsebad-0 start">

            <p>This is the exhaustive list of information that are saved at each merger. As
                seen above, email addresses of your recipients are not transmitted to our server, as well as any other
                information inside the sheet.</p>

            <h3>4. Purposes of processing and legal basis</h3>
            <p>The principal purpose of collecting your personal data is to offer you a
                safe,

                we may use your personal data to:</p>
            <ul>

                    promotional offers;</li>
                <li>prevent, detect and investigate any activities that are potentially
                    prohibited,
                    unlawful or contrary to good practice and ensure compliance with our <a href="/terms">terms of use</a> and sending
                    policy;</li>
                <li>comply with legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We use the personal data submitted to us only in accordance with the

                protection legislation.</p>

                personal data
                for the performance of the contract between us to provide our services.</p>
            <p>For our newsletter, use case studies and marketing material sign ups, we
                process

            <h3>6. Email statistics</h3>
            <p>Without systematically doing so, we may analyse and track the various rates (for example: click,
                open,
                bounce rates) and the number of emails sent which you open to assess performance rates on your
                emailing
                campaigns.</p>
            <h3>7. Testimonials</h3>

                your behalf) requests or authorises
                disclosure
                thereof; (2) the disclosure is required to process transactions
                or supply services which you have
                requested
                (i.e. to check you are employing best practice in your mailings
                or for the purposes of processing
                an
                acquisition card with credit-card issuing companies); (3)
                Mailmeteor is compelled to do so by a
                government
                authority or a regulatory body, in the case of a court order, a
                summons to appear in court or any

                or a telecommunications company).</p>
            <h3>9. Your data protection rights</h3>
            <p>In accordance with the French Data Protection Laws and
                the European General

            <h3>10. Cookies/Tracking</h3>
            <p>As a general rule, Mailmeteor uses cookies and

                personalise
                its Website and/or measure its audience.
                Cookies are files saved on your
                computer&rsquo;s hard
                drive when
                browsing on the Internet and in particular on
                our site. A cookie is not used to gather your
                personal data
                without your knowledge but instead to record
                information on site browsing which can be read
                directly by
                Mailmeteor on your subsequent visits and
                searches on the site.</p>
            <p>You can choose to decline acceptance of all
                cookies, but your ability to
                browse
                certain pages of the site may be reduced. The
                cookies used by Mailmeteor are intended to
                enable or
                facilitate communication, to enable the
                services requested by users to be supplied, to
                recognise
                users when
                they re-visit the site, to secure payments
                which users may make, to register the language
                spoken by
                users
                or other preferences necessary for the service
                requested to be supplied.</p>
            <p>Mailmeteor also uses analytics and tracking
                tools to measure website and
                digital
                data to gain customer insights, to carry out
                analyses on browsing experience so as to
                improve
                content, and
                to send targeted advertisements.</p>
            <p>By default, cookies are not installed
                automatically (with the exception of
                those
                cookies needed to run the site and
                Mailmeteor&rsquo;s services, and you are
                informed of their
                installation
                by a banner). In accordance with the
                regulations that apply, Mailmeteor will require
                your
                authorisation
                before implanting any other kind of cookie on
                your hard drive. To avoid being bothered by
                these
                routine
                requests for authorisation and to enjoy
                uninterrupted browsing, you can configure your
                computer to
                accept
                Mailmeteor cookies or we are able to remember
                your refusal or acceptance of certain cookies.
                By
                default,
                browsers accept all cookies.</p>
            <p>When you access third party sites directing you
                to our website, or when you
                are
                reading integration or social media links,
                cookies can be created by the companies
                disseminating
                these
                links. These third parties may be able to use
                cookies in the context of Mailmeteor&rsquo;s
                services
                (partners or other third parties supplying
                content or services available on the Mailmeteor
                site)
                and are
                responsible for the cookies they install and it
                is their conditions on cookies which apply.
                Mailmeteor
                assumes no liability in regard to the possible
                use of cookies by third parties. For more
                information, you
                are advised to check the cookie policy directly

                cookies.</p>
            <h2>THIRD PARTY DATA</h2>
            <p>In the context of using our services, namely
                creating bulk email campaigns,
                Mailmeteor has access to some information
                contained in the spreadsheet you created inside
                Google
                services
                (namely Google Mail and Google Spreadsheet), as
                well as the subject and content of the emails
                that
                you send
                out via our services.</p>
            <p>This data is not stored on our secure servers,
                but is processed on Google
                services
                directly. Only a limited part of such data
                (namely metadata) are transmitted to our secure
                servers,
                with a
                limited list of people that are authorised to
                access such data, in particular for the purpose
                of
                providing
                support services.</p>
            <p>You are easily able to recover, modify and or
                delete such information, at
                any time,
                right from your Google Spreadsheet. Once such
                data are removed from Google Spreadsheet, we
                are
                unable to
                retrieve metadata. If you also want to remove

            <h2>DATA RETENTION PERIODS</h2>
            <p>Mailmeteor collects your personal data
                for the requirements of carrying out
                its
                contractual obligations as well as
                information about how and when you use
                our services and we
                retain this
                data in active databases, log files or
                other types of files so long as you use
                our services.</p>
            <p>Mailmeteor only stores your data for the
                time needed to provide to you our
                services,
                and in no event no longer than 3 months
                after closing your account (unless
                otherwise required by
                law). You
                are able to access your personal data
                for as long as you hold an active
                account with us and for a
                period
                that varies depending on the type of
                data concerned. Your event data
                (statistics, for example),
                will be
                deleted every 13 months during active
                use of your account. Other data may be
                deleted at any time
                during
                active use of your account in
                accordance with the provisions set
                forth above.</p>
            <h2>LOCATION OF DATA STORAGE AND TRANSFERS</h2>
            <p>The host servers on which Mailmeteor
                processes and stores its databases are
                located
                exclusively within the Google
                infrastructure, in European Union and
                United States of America.
            </p>

            <p>Mailmeteor will inform you immediately,
                to the extent we are legally
                authorised to
                do so, in case of any application or
                order originating from an
                administrative or judicial authority
                relating to your personal data.</p>
            <h2>SECURITY</h2>
            <p>Within the framework of its services,
                Mailmeteor attributes the very highest
                importance to the security and
                integrity of its customers&rsquo;
                personal data.</p>
            <p>Thus and in accordance with the GDPR,
                Mailmeteor undertakes to take all
                pertinent
                precautions in order to preserve the
                security of the data and, in
                particular, to protect them
                against any
                accidental or unlawful destruction,
                accidental loss, corruption,
                unauthorised circulation or
                access, as
                well as against any other form of
                unlawful processing or disclosure to
                unauthorised persons.</p>
            <p>To this end, Mailmeteor implements
                industry standard security measures to
                protect
                personal data from unauthorised
                disclosure. In using industry
                recommended methods of encoding,
                Mailmeteor
                takes the measures necessary to protect
                information connected with payments and
                credit cards.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in order to avoid in
                particular all unauthorised access, to
                guarantee
                accuracy and the proper use of the
                data, Mailmeteor has put the
                appropriate electronic, physical
                and
                managerial procedures in place with a
                view to safeguarding and preserving the
                data gathered through
                its
                services.</p>
            <p>Nothwithstanding this, there is no
                absolute safety from piracy or hackers.
                That is
                why in the event a breach of security
                were to affect you, Mailmeteor
                undertakes to inform you
                thereof
                without undue delay and to use its best
                efforts to take all possible measures
                to neutralise the
                intrusion
                and minimise the impacts. Should you
                suffer any loss by reason of the
                exploitation by a third party
                of a
                security breach, Mailmeteor undertakes
                to provide you with every assistance
                necessary so you are
                able to
                assert your rights. Moreover if, by
                some exceptional case, the direct loss
                incurred arose due to
                fault or
                gross negligence by Mailmeteor, you
                will be able to seek compensation
                within the limit of liability
                referred to in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
            <p>You should keep in mind that any user,
                customer or hacker who discovers and
                takes
                advantage of a breach in security
                renders him or herself liable to
                criminal prosecution and that
                Mailmeteor
                will take all measures, including
                filing a complaint and/or bringing
                court action, to preserve the
                data and
                the rights of its users and of itself
                and to limit the impacts.</p>
