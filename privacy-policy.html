    the Limited Use requirements.
  </p>

  <!--<div style="padding: 3rem; background-color: #f4f7fe; margin: 1rem 0">
    <p>In particular, use of data obtained from Google APIs (such as Google Sheets spreadsheets data or Gmail's data) comply with the following requirements:</p>

        be clear to our users why and how we use the scope data they've chosen to share with you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Allowed Transfer:</strong> Mailmeteor will transfer user data to others only if that transfer is (a) necessary to provide or improve user-facing features that are
        prominent from the requesting app's user interface, (b) to comply with applicable laws, or (c) a part of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets of Mailmeteor. All other

        (for example, for tech support), (b) it's necessary for security purposes (for example, investigating abuse), (c) to comply with applicable laws, and (d) Mailmeteor
