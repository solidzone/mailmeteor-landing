    body: 'So far, the free version seems pretty awesome. I was able to easily create and send my first email campaign. The preview and send test email features both were helpful. But we probably will upgrade, to use features in the paid app - to view reports, send a larger number of emails, and send emails with individual PDF attachments (not links to individual files). Stay tuned...'

I like that the GUI to create the template is within the Google Sheet, you don't have to switch back and forth between sheets and gmail like with some other mail merge programs. Really convenient and simple to use."

I'm still getting to utilize its full power in helping send out bulk emails with ease instead of sitting down spending hours organizing list and another hour sending one after the other. Definitely give it a shot."

    body: 'This is a great product. I was so used to YAMM that I didn''t think to try something new until I just said well let''s give it a shot. My favorite feature of this Mail Merge product is that you can preview the email in the application window on Google Sheets instead of having to send yourself a "test" email. Smart! You''ll enjoy it, give it a try for sure!'

Soy docente y con la actual pandemia se nos ha triplicado el trabajo, por cambiar las clases a una modalidad no presencial. <br/>Pensar en tener que enviar 500 correos para mis estudiantes en verdad me causaba mucho estrés y ansiedad, hasta que un colega me dijo de este maravillosa aplicación. Desde entonces se me ha facilitado el envío de información y eso a su vez, me ha permitido disminuir mi carga de trabajo y optimizar tiempos en otras actividades. <br/>Gracias infinitas al creador!!!'

    body: 'Excelente complemento para Mala Direta. Não exige conhecimento de expert, intuitivo e de fácil configuração. Completamente integrado num único produto: Não precisa fazer rascunho no Gmail. Você pode manter vários modelos de correspondência previamente configurados com os campos dos cabeçalhos de sua planilha (ex.:{{nome do destinatário}}) e enviá-los quando quiser. E o melhor: A maior cota de envios diários (100 cotas) na versão gratuita, e mais de 1000 por dia com o upgrade, nesse caso com suporte ao rastreamento do status do seus e-mail enviados (ex.:saber se o destinatário recebeu ou leu seu e-mail). O melhor complemento do gênero Mail Merge na G Suite Marketplace, na minha opinião. Recomendo.<br/><br/>Excellent complement to Mail Merge. It does not require expert knowledge, intuitive and easy to configure. Completely integrated in a single product: No need to draft in Gmail. You can keep several correspondence templates previously configured with the header fields in your spreadsheet (eg :{{recipient name}}) and send them whenever you want. And the best: The highest quota of daily shipments (100 quotas) in the free version, and more than 1000 per day with the upgrade, in this case with support for tracking the status of your sent e-mails (eg: know if the recipient received or read your email). The best complement of the Mail Merge genre in the G Suite Marketplace, in my opinion. I recommend.'

Although I am not in a marketing role, my job does require for several emails to be sent throughout the course of a 3 month time period, and Mailmeteor makes my job 10x easier and communication efforts 100x's more effective. I have used other mass email extensions and this one is by far the best i've used. I love how it integrates with google sheets, and how it tracks every email that has been sent just in case I have to go back to it on a later date. I hight recommend Mailmeteor."
