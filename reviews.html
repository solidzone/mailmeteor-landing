    body: "Loving how easy it is to send simple emails in bulk from Gmail with this tool. I spend so much money on Mailchimp and the emails so often are dumped in people's junk folders - let's hope this is a fresh new way to reach my potential customers. It's certainly simple to use - so saving me time already! Give it a try."

    body: 'Very easy to use. I have used both the paid and unpaid versions of Mail Meteor. You cannot find a simpler way to bulk send individually customized emails. The best explanation is to think of this as like the old mail merge process that everyone used in a word processor. You create a spreadsheet containing your email address list and any customizable fields or data you need. Then you create your email and add the column header labels as merge fields. You can preview, you can receive a test email, but when you are ready, you send it and Mail Meteor does the rest. The outgoing messages show up individually in your sent mail folder just like you had typed each one individually by hand! It does not get any better than that!'

    body: 'The Mailmeteor mail merge app is an excellent and easy to use tool. It greatly helped us with our bulk email communications to conference authors during the NSChE Eko 2021. The experience was very positive, especially that we could use the tool without any subscriptions. I guess the subscription service would even be a better experience. However, we did not need to use this for the number bulk emails that we required.<br/>Many thanks to the Mailmeteor team for creating such an easy to use app along with Gmail.<br/><br/>Regards<br/>NSChE Eko2021 Conference'

My one gripe is managing spread sheets ... it would be nice to be able to select only some of the contacts on a sheet so that you do not have to create a new tab and copy/paste contacts over for each send. Other than that, this works great. Huge time saver. And best of all ... it's free for 75 daily sends!"
