Dear friend,

I am a Financial Consultant in control of privately owned funds placed for long term investments.

My client intends to invest these funds in projects. I am willing to finance projects at a guaranteed 5% ROI per annum for projects ranging from 2 years term and above but not exceeding 12 years.

Please answer ASAP.</textarea

  <p>
    Including spam words in your email doesn’t automatically mean it will be sent to the spam folder. If you use a few
    of these words in context, as part of the flow of your email, then you’ll be okay – especially if your emails are
    being read by your recipients.
  </p>
