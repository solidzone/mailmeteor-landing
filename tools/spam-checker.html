Dear friend,

I am a Financial Consultant in control of privately owned funds placed for long term investments.

My client intends to invest these funds in projects. I am willing to finance projects at a guaranteed 5% ROI per annum for projects ranging from 2 years term and above but not exceeding 12 years.

Please answer ASAP.</textarea

    <h2>How does this spam checker tool work?</h2>
    <p>This tool looks for <a href="/blog/spam-words">spam trigger words</a> in your email. Spam words are keywords or expressions that email service providers see as red flags.</p>     
    <p>We divided spam keywords into 5 main categories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Urgency ðŸš¨ - words that pressure recipients</li>
      <li>Shady ðŸ”ž  - ethically or legally questionable words</li>
      <li>Overpromise ðŸ¤© - exaggerated claims</li>
      <li>Money ðŸ’° - all things related to money in general</li>
      <li>Unnatural ðŸ’¬ - words that don't feel natural</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>The spam checker tool will highlight words that could be avoided or rephrased in your email. To do so, we compiled the most exhaustive <a href="/blog/spam-words#spam-words-list">spam words list</a> to avoid in your emails.</p>
    <p>
      Remember that if your copy contains one or a few spam words, it doesn't necessarily mean your email will be considered spam. Using words in their context is fine.
    </p>
